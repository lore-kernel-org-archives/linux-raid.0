You're looking at today.  We're discussing tomorrow's needs.  Today's
6TB 3.5" drives have sustained average throughput of ~175MB/s.
Tomorrow's 20TB drives will be lucky to do 300MB/s.  As I said
previously, at that rate a straight disk-disk copy of a 20TB drive takes
18.6 hours.  This is what you get with RAID1/10/51.  In the real world,
rebuilding a failed drive in a 3P array of say 8 of these disks will
likely take at least 3 times as long, 2 days 6 hours minimum, probably
more.  This may be perfectly acceptable to some, but probably not to all.

He wrote that article in late 2009.  It seems pretty clear he wasn't
looking 10 years forward to 20TB drives, where the minimum mirror
rebuild time will be ~18 hours, and parity rebuild will be much greater.
