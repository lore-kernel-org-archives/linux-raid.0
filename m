I'm not sure it's that. I have a Core i5 with AES-NI and that didn't 
significantly increase my overall performance, as it's not there the 
bottleneck is (at least in my system).

I earlier sent out an email wondering if someone could shed some light on 
how scheduling, block caching and read-ahead works together when one does 
disks->md->crypto->lvm->fs, becase that's a lot of layers and potentially 
a lot of unneeded buffering, readahead and scheduling magic?
