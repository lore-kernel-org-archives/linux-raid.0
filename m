Dear all,

So here is a new version of the patches to be reviewed, this time as
suggested by Alasdair the patches are reworked to match with the new
dmsetup bootformat feature [1]. These patches are not reviewed yet but
the format was discussed in the IRC and was suggested to send the
kernel patches in parallel.

Changes since v6:
 - Add a new function to issue the equivalent of a DM ioctl programatically.
 - Use the new ioctl interface to create the devices.
 - Use a comma-delimited and semi-colon delimited dmsetup-like commands.

Changes since v5:
 - https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-February/msg00112.html

[1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-lvm/2017-May/msg00047.html

Wating for your feedback,

Enric Balletbo i Serra (1):
  dm ioctl: add a device mapper ioctl function.

Will Drewry (1):
  init: add support to directly boot to a mapped device
