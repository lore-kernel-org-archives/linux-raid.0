I can understand the frustration of these details being irretrievably
hidden behind a proprietary interface out of the filesystem's control.
 However, this is not the case with Linux software RAID.  I suspect
that there is room for more interaction with even "legacy" filesystems
to communicate things like: "don't worry about initializing that
region of the disk it's all free space", "don't bother resyncing on
dirty shutdown, if power-loss interrupts a write I guarantee I will
replay the entire stripe to you at a later date", or "hey, that last
block I read doesn't checksum, can you come up with a different
version?"

I was under the impression that btrfs wanted to leverage md's stripe
handling logic as well, seems that is not the case?

async_xor() handles arbitrary block counts.
