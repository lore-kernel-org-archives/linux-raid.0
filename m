So the core problem is that your crypto accelerator can operate efficiently only
with bigger batch sizes.

How big blocks your crypto hw need to be able to operate more efficiently?
What about 4k blocks (no batches), could it be usable trade-off?

With some (backward incompatible) changes in LUKS format I would like to see support
for encryption blocks equivalent to sectors size, so it basically means for 4k drive 4k
encryption block.
(This should decrease overhead, now is everything processed on 512 blocks only.)

Support of bigger block sizes would be unsafe without additional mechanism that provides
atomic writes of multiple sectors. Maybe it applies to 4k as well on some devices though...)

The above is not going against your proposal, I am just curious if this is enough
to provide better performance on your hw accelerator or not.
