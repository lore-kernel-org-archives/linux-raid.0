The largest contributors seem to be
$ zcat slabinfo.txt.gz | awk '{printf "%s %d\n" , $1, $6*$15}' | head_and_tail.sh 133 | paste-with-diff.sh | sort -n -k3
			initial	diff [#pages]
radix_tree_node 	3444    2592
debug_objects_cache     388     46159
file_lock_ctx   	114     138570
buffer_head     	5616    238704
kmalloc-256     	328     573164
bio-3   		24      1118984

So it seems we are accumulating bios and 256B objects. Buffer heads as
well but so much. Having over 4G worth of bios sounds really suspicious.
Note that they pin pages to be written so this might be consuming the
rest of the unaccounted memory! So the main question is why those bios
do not get dispatched or finished.
