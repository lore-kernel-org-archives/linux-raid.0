Hi Song, I've tested both RAID5 (with 3 disks, removing one at a time),
and also RAID 1 (2 disks, also removing one at a time); no issues
observed in kernel 5.1. We can see one interesting message in kernel
log: "super_written gets error=10", which corresponds to md detecting
the error (bi_status == BLK_STS_IOERROR) and instantly failing the
write, making FS read-only.

So, I think really the issue happens only in RAID0, which writes
"blindly" to its components.
Let me know your thoughts - thanks again for your input!

Cheers,


Guilherme
