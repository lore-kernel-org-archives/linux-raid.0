I gave it a spin on a x86_64 with 8 CPUs with AES-NI using cryptd and
on Arm  using CryptoCell hardware accelerator.

There was no difference in performance between 512 and 4096 bytes
cluster size on the x86_64 (800 MB loop file system)

There was an improvement in latency of 3.2% between 512 and 4096 bytes
cluster size on the Arm. I expect the performance benefits for this
test for Binoy's patch to be the same.

In both cases the very naive test was a simple dd with block size of
4096 bytes or the raw block device.

I do not know what effect having a bigger cluster size would have on
have on other more complex file system operations.
Is there any specific benchmark worth testing with?
