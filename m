Hi Milan,

Thank you for the reply. Yes, that would be rather an improvement when having
bigger block sizes.

The benchmark results for Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC's (mentioned below) show
significant improvement with 4K blocks but in batches of all such contiguous
segments in the block layer's request queue in the form of a chained
scatterlist.
However, it uses the algorithm 'aes-xts' instead of the conventional
'essiv-cbc-aes'
used in dm-crypt. Also, it uses the device mapper dm-req-crypt instead
of dm-cypt.

Section : 'Performance'

Its reports and IO rate of 46.3MB/s compared to an IO rate of 25.1MB/s while
using a software-based FDE (based on dm-crypt).  But I am not sure how genuine
this data is or how it was tested.

Since qualcomm SoC's use hardware backed keystore for managing keys and since
there is no easy way to make dm-crypt work with qualcomm's engines, I do not
have solid benchmark data to show an improved performance when using 4k blocks.

Did you mean write to the crypto output buffers or the actual disk write?
I didn't quite understand how the block size for encryption affects atomic
writes as it is the block layer which handles them. As far as dm-crypt is,
concerned it just encrypts/decrypts a 'struct bio' instance and submits the IO
operation to the block layer.

May be I should be able to procure an open crypto board and get back to you with
some results. Or may be show even a marginal improvement while using software
algorithm by avoiding the crypto overhead for every 512 bytes.
