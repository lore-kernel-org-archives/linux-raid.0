Eh, well, no.
He is asking about "md" in case the underlying
layer, dm-integrity in this case, returns an error.

This could be the case also if the HDD returns
a read error which the RAID will correct and,
if I get it right, rewrite.

But I guess "md" already returns where the
correction happened, isn't like that?
I recall seeing in the logs something about
it, but it was some time ago...
