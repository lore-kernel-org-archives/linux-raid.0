There's really no point to it anymore. It's existance was due to the
older revision that had to track write requests for serializaing around
a barrier. I'll kill it, since we don't do that anymore.

The existance and out-of-line is for the scheduler() hook. It should be
an unlikely event to schedule with a plug held, normally the plug should
have been explicitly unplugged before that happens.

That one can probably go, I need to double check that part since some
things changed.

It depends on whether this was an explicit unplug (eg
blk_finish_plug()), or whether it was an implicit event (eg on
schedule()). If we do it on schedule(), then we retain the plug after
the flush. Otherwise we clear it.

Already answered in other email.
