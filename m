Worth sharing a pointer to a really neat set of papers that describe 
open source friendly RAID6 and erasure encoding algorithms that were 
presented last year and this at FAST:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/papers.html

If I remember correctly, James Plank's papers also have implemented and 
benchmarked the various encodings,
