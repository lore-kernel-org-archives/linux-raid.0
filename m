Yes, I have sent it to linux-block as well, and he has commented as well.

Yes, it should. I will add a check before setting the flag. Thanks.
Request-based devices don't wait. So, they would not have this flag set.
It is only the bio-based, with the  make_request_fn hook which need this.

No, from a multi-device point of view, this is inconsistent. I have
tried the request bio returns -EAGAIN before the split, but I shall
check again. Where do you see this happening?
