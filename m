And then there are SAN devices managed by multipath, were the timeouts
should maybe even lower.  I know in the scsi layer there are some
extra retries going on and that that actual timeout hits at 5x the
base timeout.  So there kind of is a soft timeout on SAN devices at
the base timeout.    Though there are no messages before the 5x
timeout message indicating that the system is having issues at least
in the SAN case.

For mdraid it should almost be a parameter defined on the md-device to
override the timeout since one could have some disks with ERC and some
without.  Multipath.conf has a setting fast_io_fail_tmo that is
supposed to set the scsi timeout to that value if set.
