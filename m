Yeah.  Somedays it seems like there are a lot of pieces in play here.
The security labels on sysfs seems to be a very compelling case.

Thank you for pointing that out.  I will look into that.

I believe I know exactly what you are talking about.  Of the choices I
think it is better to a minor localized change in the fs_fully_visible
logic than it is to cause problems elsewhere.

And thank you for keeping everything as separate patches.  That is at
least helping me catch up.  Even if I don't agree that these things
should be separate come merge time.
