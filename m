This is a work in progress and something that turned out to be much
harder than I anticipated.  Discard is not the only problem child here.
The other one is write same.  In both cases we'll have to split things
that cover an area bigger than the corresponding bio_vec payload.

At first I took the blk_pc splitting approach but it got really hairy
and had lots of special casing.  So what I'm working on right now is to
make write same and discard requests first class citizens so they can be
split and merged like regular write requests.  There are lots of
assumptions in our stack about things being either read or write so it's
a pretty invasive change.  But at this point it looks like it'll be
nicer than my first attempt.  Still plugging away at it though...
