If you can lock stripes, and make sure any old data from that stripe is
flushed from the caches (if you change it while locked), then that
sounds ideal.

I don't know what sort of interface you have for the user, but I guess
that means you'll have to collect a number of failures before showing
them so that the user can see the correlation on disk number.

It could occur as the result of a failure of some sort (kernel crash,
power failure, temporary disk problem, etc.).  More generally, md raid
doesn't have to be on local physical disks - maybe one of the "disks" is
an iSCSI drive or something else over a network that could have failures
or delays.  I haven't thought through all cases here - I am just
throwing them out as possibilities that might cause trouble.
