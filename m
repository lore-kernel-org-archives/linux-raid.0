It's not just so easy. See below.

I tried to move out work_struct, it didn't help. There are actually
several circular dependencies that ends in bitmap.h either way or
another.

First one is

slab.h -> gfp.h -> mmzone.h -> nodemask.h -> bitmap.h

And so on...

Splitting out kXalloc stuff to a separate header won't help, I think,
because of the above.
Splitting out struct work_struct is just a tip of an iceberg.
Splitting out memcg stuff won't help in the similar way.

I'm all ears for (a better) solution.
