Are you sure?

You seem to be saying that WRITE_SYNC causes the write to be safe on
media before the request returns.  That isn't my understanding.
I think (from comments near the definition and a quick grep through
the code) that WRITE_SYNC expedites the delivery of the request
through the elevator, but doesn't do anything special about getting it
onto the media.
It essentially say "Submit this request now, don't wait for more
request to bundle with it for better bandwidth utilisation"
