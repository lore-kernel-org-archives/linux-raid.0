Very grateful for your feedback. I'm sorry I didn't check much data
correctness, mostly focus on the encryption speed. It looks like there
are something wrong when I follow your test procedure. I will optimize
the driver and need to be known much about XTS mode to check why it
can not work. Thanks.
