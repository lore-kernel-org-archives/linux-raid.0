Well, using SSD as a caching layer is probably everything else but
normal usage. Caching involves writing a lot of data given the fact
that it usually backs huge storage pools and is there to eliminate/hide
inefficient usage patterns of rotational media. Caching layers like
bcache do its best to turn writes to the device into optimal write
patterns at best - but still, it writes a lot of data.

I had a Crucial MX100 128GB SSD as bcache (writeback mode) in the past.
It lasted exactly 12-13 months when I was forced to replace it: The
lifetime of the SSD reached around 95% according to smartctl. The specs
say, it has a lifetime guarantee of 85TB written. I guess it could have
lasted longer due to bcache's optimized access patterns - but I didn't
want to test it. Bigger SSDs usually last a lot longer, so now I'm
using a Samsung 850 Evo 500GB which has a guarantee of 150TBW.
According to tests, it probably goes a lot higher before failing (like
250TBW estimated) but I don't want to test this is writeback mode.

So the idea of reducing writes to the caching layer, or better
eliminate useless writes altogether, would be very welcome.
