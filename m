This patch _really_ concerns me because just in DM alone I found you
took liberties that you shouldn't have and created a regression.  First
issue is a real bug (your proposed dm-io.c:dmio_complete change missed
that dm-io uses error_bits and not traditional error code like expected)
the other issue being you added extra branching that isn't needed and
made review more tedious (dm.c:clone_endio).

I'll defer to others to check their respective areas of expertise but my
experience with this review should really underscore the need for more
eyes on this patch.  That said, I do appreciate your effort on cleaning
this up!

For DM, please add Signed-off-by: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com> once
you've folded in this patch, thanks!
