AFAIK the problem that we are trying to solve is that if the IV is
generated outside the crypto API
domain than you are forced to have an invocation of the crypto API per
each block because you
need to provide the IV for each block.

By putting the IV generation responsibility in the Crypto API we open
the way to do a single invocation
of the crypto API for a whole sequence of blocks.

For software implementation of XTS this doesn't matter much - but for
hardware based XTS providers
that can do the IV generation themselves it's the difference between a
sequence of small invocation,
with all the overhead that that entails  and a single big invocatio -
and this can be big.

This lead some vendors to ship hacked up versions of dm-crypt to match
the specific crypto hardware
they were using, or so I've heard at least - didn't see the code myself.

I believe Binoy is trying to address this in a generic upstream worthy
way instead.

Anyway, you are only supposed to see s difference when using a
hardware based XTS provider algo
that supports IV generation.

The point is that you have more than one implementation of these
"compatible crap" - the
software implementation that you wrote and potentially multiple
hardware implementations
and putting this in the crypto API domain is the way to abstract this
so you use the one
that works best of your platform.
