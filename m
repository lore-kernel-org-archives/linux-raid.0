Now that perf is available it would be good to get some comparative
cache utilization statistics on the two approaches.  The assembly
routines make an attempt to avoid polluting L2 (however the memcpy's
into the cache do not).

Where did the investigation of reusing md/raid5.c [1] end up?  This
would simultaneously enable hardware accelerated raid6 for dmraid.
