Preallocation showed the problem, too, so we probably don't even
need dd to check whether allocation alignment is working properly.
We should probably write a test that spefically checks all the
different anlignment/extent size combinations we can use.

Preallocation should behave very similarly to direct IO, but I'm
pretty sure that it won't do things like round up allocations to
stripe unit/widths like direct IO does. The fact that we do
allocation sunit/swidth size alignment for direct Io outside the
allocator and sunit/swidth offset alignment inside the allocation is
kinda funky....

Not surprising, it is a one in several hundred test runs occurrence
here...

Cheers,

Dave.
