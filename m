It is perfectly fine to use another IV even for XTS mode (despite it is not needed).
You can use ESSIV for example, or benbi (big-endian variant of plain IV).
(And it is really used for some LUKS devices.)

How it is supposed to work in this case?
If I read this patch correctly, it will completely corrupt data in this case because
it expects plain (consecutive) IV...

Also how it handles 32bit plain IV (that restart after 2TB)? (IOW plain IV, not plain64).
