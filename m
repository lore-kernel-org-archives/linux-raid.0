(or to the wrong place on the disk which for pre SATA is actually
possibly more likely as the command transfers are not CRC protected on
the cable - just slower, while the data is CRC protected). SATA fixes
this.

Does it matter to the poor victim ? At this point you get into putting
mirrors on disks A & B with their integrity on the opposite pair so if
one forgets to do I/O hopefully both won't.

To be honest if you are really really paranoid you don't do link layer
checksumming anyway (which is what this is) you checksum in the apps using
the data set. That protects you against lots of error cases in the
memory/cache system and on network transmissions. On big clusters
crunching enormous amounts of data all those 1 in 10^lots bit error rates
become such that it's worth the effort.

Seems reasonably paranoid - drives will do things under you like commit
data to disk out in a different order to the commands unless the cache
gets flushed between them but the barrier code should do that bit.
