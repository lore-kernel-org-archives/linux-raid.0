Sadly, I couldn't get this go as just "the way things were" in case
there was some major speedup to be had here.  :-P

I tracked this down to shrink_list() taking 1 ms per call (perhaps
because I have HZ=1000?) and in shrink_lruvec() the outer loop ran
many thousands of times.  Thus the total time taken by shrink_lruvec()
could easily be many seconds.

Wow, interesting, when I change HZ to 100 instead of 1000 then the
behavior changes quite a bit.  I can still get my bufio lock warning
easily, but all of a sudden shrink_lruvec() isn't slow.  :-P

OK, really truly going to stop digging further now...  ;)  Presumably
reporting weird behaviors with old kernels doesn't help anyone in
mainline, and I can buy the whole "memory accesses are slow when you
start thrashing the system" argument.
