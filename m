Hi Song, I don't believe it changes the complexity/"appearance" of the
code. Both patches are "relatives" in the ideas' realm, but their code
is different in nature. My goal in splitting them was to make more
bisect-able changes.

But feel free to merge them in a single patch or let me know if you
prefer that way and I can do it.

There's also a chance I haven't understood your statement/question
correctly heh - if that's the case, please clarify me!
Cheers,

Guilherme
