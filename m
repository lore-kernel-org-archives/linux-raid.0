I am Alex.  This is something I never removed.  I haven't
looked at it closely now, but it seems to me that after I
created a function that split stuff properly up *before*
the BIO layer got to it (which has since been replaced by
code related to Kent's immutable BIO work), there has been
no need for this function.  Removing this was on a long-ago
to-do list--but I didn't want to do it without spending some
time ensuring it wouldn't break anything.

If you want me to work through it in more detail so I can
give a more certain response, let me know and I will do so.
