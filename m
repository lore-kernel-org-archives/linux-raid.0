Yes, there really are (or were). But I don't think that there are 
drivers, so it's not an issue.

That is why there are no drivers...

If they can function usefully without, the admin gets to make that choice.

I don't see how you can have reliable operation without it, particularly 
WRT bitmap.

Since this is device dependent, it really should be in the device 
driver, and requests should have status of success, failure, or feature 
unavailability.

Well, we're really talking about network attached devices rather than 
network filesystems. I guess people do lump them together.

Pretty much agrees with what I said above, it's at a level closer to the 
device, and status should come back from the physical i/o request.

Hopefully.
