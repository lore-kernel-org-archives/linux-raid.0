You are only looking at the values of these flags.

The semantics of both these flags are different and both
flags are set in different members of "struct dma_device"
The DMA_HAS_PQ_CONTINUE is set in "max_pq" whereas
DMA_HAS_FEWER_PQ_COEF is set in "max_pqcoef".

When DMA_HAS_PQ_CONTINUE is set in "max_pq", it
means that PQ HW is capable of taking P & Q computed
previous txn as input. If DMA_HAS_PQ_CONTINUE is
not supported the async_pq() will pass P & Q computed
by previous txn as sources with coef as g^0.

When DMA_HAS_FEWER_PQ_COEF is set in "max_pqcoef",
it means the PQ HW is not capable of handling all 256 coefs.

Thanks for NAKing this patch.

This motivated me to find clean work-around for handling
unsupported PQ coefs in BCM-SBA-RAID driver.

Let's assume max number of PQ coefs supported by PQ HW
is m coefs. Now for any coef n > m, we can use RAID6 math
to get g^n = (g^m)*(g^m)*....*(g^k) where k <= m.

Using the above fact, we can create chained txn for each
source of PQ request in BCM-SBA-RAID driver where each
txn will only compute PQ from one source using above
described RAID6 math. Also, each txn in chained txn will
depend on output of previous txn because we are computing
PQ from one source at a time.

I will drop this patch and send updated BCM-SBA-RAID
driver with above described work-around for handling
unsupported PQ coefs.

Anup
