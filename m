Hmm, looks like the new blk_queue_split_bio ignore the chunk_sectors
value, another thing that needs updating.  I forgot how many weird
merging hacks we had to add for nvme..

While I'd like to see per-driver patches we'd still need to merge
them together through the block tree.  Note that with this series
there won't be any benefit of using blk_queue_chunk_sectors over just
doing the split in rbd.  Maybe we can even remove it again and do
that work in the drivers in the future.
