Thanks for your suggestion. But let me explain it again. Now for many
vendors, they supply the encryption hardware (such as AES engine) to
accelerate the encyrtion/decryption speed with handling a big block at
one time. So if we want the hardware engine can play the best
performance, the size of block handled at one time need to be
expanded.

But it can only handle one bio at one time for bio based dm-crypt, one
bio has a size limitation and one bio's size can't make the hardware
engine reach its best performance. So we want to introduce the request
based dm-crypt. For request based things, some sequential bios can
merged into one request to expand the IO size to be a big block
handled by hardware engine at one time. With the hardware
acceleration, it can improve the encryption/decryption speed.

I think 3 questions need to be clarified.

1. Are there ways of enhancing the dm-crypt bio-based target to overcome this?
The focus is the size limitation of one bio, its size can not meet the
hardware requirement. But one request can have a big block size with
merging multiple bios. So I think the request is the best choice.

2. Would any sort of bio aggregation mechanism help?
The request can combined sequential bios by block layer automatically.
But for bio aggregation, I think it will be similar to that, why do we
need recomplement it again?

3. perforamence data
It is just a simple dd test result, and will provide the formal report
in future. But from the simple test, we can see the improvement.
Hardware environment:
Board: beaglebone black
processor: AM335x 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8
RAM: 512M
Cipher: cbc(aes) with AES hardware engine

(1) bio based dm-crypt with hardware accelarate:
read 64M command: dd if=/dev/dm-0 of=/dev/null bs=512k count=128 iflag=direct
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 11.6592 s, 5.8 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 11.6391 s, 5.8 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 11.6296 s, 5.8 MB/s

(2) request based dm-crypt with hardware accelarate
read 64M command: dd if=/dev/dm-0 of=/dev/null bs=512k count=128 iflag=direct
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 5.16586 s, 13.0 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 5.19338 s, 12.9 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 5.19169 s, 12.9 MB/s

(3) bio based dm-crypt with hardware accelarate
write 64M command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/dm-0 bs=512k count=128 iflag=direct
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 13.6852 s, 4.9 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 14.0873 s, 4.8 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 13.6649 s, 4.9 MB/s

(4) request based dm-crypt with hardware accelarate
write 64M command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/dm-0 bs=512k count=128 iflag=direct
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 7.27832 s, 9.2 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 7.29051 s, 9.2 MB/s
67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 7.28318 s, 9.2 MB/s

From the simple result, we can see it at least has a double
improvement of the encryption performance.
