OK, I also think it is only sensible to reuse the code already done.
I misunderstood then your mail on not to repeat mistakes - which I took to mean that
Barrow should not implement things with mistakes. Maybe that means to not make hooks
to MD code that is a mistake?

So Barrow will implement the improved far layout once there is MD code for it, and
then he can make the neceessary hooks in DM code?

On further investigations I agree that you can survive more than one drive failing with
the current layout.

Well, I have an idea for the odd number of devices:
Have the disks arranged in groups (for N=2 in pairs) and then the last group extended with
the leftover disks in the way it is done now.

For 2 copies, this would be a number of pairs, and then a rest group of 3 disks.
For 3 copies, this would be a number of triplets, and then 4 or 5 disks in the last group.

Can I assume, Neil, that you agree with the rest I wrote? :-)
Especially that we should only advice the new layout, and there is no reason for the
current implementation except for backwards compatibility?
