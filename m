It's still not OK, some drivers end up doing spin_unlock_irq() in their
request_fn. Running unknown request_fn from ipi/irq is a bad idea, imho,
it'll quickly cause problems.

Yes, I argued the same for the original people who saw the problem. It
is quite an extensive and expensive path to have off the IPI handler. So
from that point of view, I'd recommend the patch as well.
