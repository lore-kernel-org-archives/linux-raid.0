We don't need to screw around with the sector size - that is
irrelevant to the problem, and we have an allocation alignment
test that is supposed to catch these issues: generic/223.

As I said, I have seen occasional failures of that test (once a
month, on average) as a result of this bug. It was simply not often
enough - running in a hard loop didn't increase the frequency of
failures - to be able debug it or to reach my "there's a regression
I need to look at" threshold. Perhaps we need to revisit that test
and see if we can make it more likely to trigger failures...

Cheers,

Dave.
