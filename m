Theoretically, options explicitly specified in KBUILD_CFLAGS
should be always valid.
Options that may not be supported in some cases
should be wrapped with $(call cc-option ).

There is a rare case where a particular combination fails
(such as the conflict between -pg and -ffunction-sections
as reported in https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9624573/).

In a such case, we may end up with swapping the order,
but this should not happen quite often.
