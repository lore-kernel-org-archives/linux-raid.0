Hi

Here I'm sending a patch for this bug.

BTW. I found several other bugs in bcache when testing this.

1) make-bcache and the other tools do not perform endian conversion - 
consequently bcache doesn't work on big-endian machines.

2) bcache cannot be compiled on newer gcc because of inline keyword. Note 
that in GNU C, the inline keyword is just a hint that doesn't change 
correntness or behavior of a program. However, according to ANSI C, the 
inline keywork changes meaning of a program - GCC recently switched to 
ANSI C by default and so the code doesn't compile. This is a patch:

	--- bcache-tools.orig/bcache.c
	+++ bcache-tools/bcache.c
	@@ -115,7 +115,7 @@ static const uint64_t crc_table[256] = {
	        0x9AFCE626CE85B507ULL
	 };

	-inline uint64_t crc64(const void *_data, size_t len)
	+uint64_t crc64(const void *_data, size_t len)
	 {
	        uint64_t crc = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
	        const unsigned char *data = _data;

3) dm-crypt returns large bios with -EIO and bcache responds by attempting 
to submit the bios again and again (which results in the reported loop). 
The patch below fixes dm-crypt to not return errors, however you should 
also fix bcache to handle errors gracefully (i.e. stop using the device on 
I/O error, and don't submit the bios over and over again).

dm-crypt: Fix error with too large bios

When dm-crypt processes writes, it allocates a new bio in the function
crypt_alloc_buffer. The bio is allocated from a bio set and it can have at
most BIO_MAX_PAGES vector entries, however the incoming bio can be larger
if it was allocated by other means. For example, bcache creates bios
larger than BIO_MAX_PAGES. If the incoming bio is larger, bio_alloc_bioset
fails and error is returned.

To avoid the error, we test for too large bio in the function crypt_map
and dm_accept_partial_bio to split the bio. dm_accept_partial_bio trims
the current bio to the desired size and requests that the device mapper
core sends another bio with the rest of the data.
