Btw, it's really getting time to make Linux storage fs work out the
box.  There's way to many things that are stupid by default and we
require everyone to fix up manually:

 - the ridiculously low max_sectors default
 - the very small max readahead size
 - replacing cfq with deadline (or noop)
 - the too small RAID5 stripe cache size

and probably a few I forgot about.  It's time to make things perform
well out of the box..
