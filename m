Maybe that is where I saw it before - I thought I had.

I can do "waiting" (as long as you can help with the waking up when the time
comes).

ectors_per_dev, but secondarily I am checking for other conditions - like n=
ot aligning on chunk boundaries or not being evenly divisible.  Failure to =
set sectors_per_dev - or set it correctly - results in an ill-sized array (=
mddev->array_sectors).  The per device value is not passed in via DM table =
either - it must be computed.  So, I don't understand why it is pointless.

The division is certainly needed.  Getting the correct "sectors_per_dev" is
obviously required.
It is the testing of the remainder that is pointless.  A non-zero remainder
is not necessarily bad, a zero remainder is not a guarantee that everything
is good.
The test that ti->len =3D=3D rs->md.array_sectors (which you included, than=
ks) is
the important test and it makes all the other tests on sizes redundant.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
