It should at very least be renamed.  But I still can't figure out what
it is for exactly.

There are three users:

 (1) virtio_blk::virtblk_get_id():
	This looks like it really should just use blk_rq_map_kern.
 (2) osd_initiator::_make_request():
	This one looks like it should just use the same scheme as
	sg_io(), as it's doing the same thing.
 (3) target_core_pscsi::__pscsi_map_SG():
	Same as (2).
