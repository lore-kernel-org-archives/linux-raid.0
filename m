The check on 'bio->bi_vcnt == 1' is introduced in commit de3ec86dff160(dm:
don't start current request if it would've merged with the previous), which
fixed one performance issue.[1]

Looks the idea of the patch is to delay dispatching the rq if it
would've merged with previous request and the rq is small(single bvec).
I guess the motivation is to try to increase chance of merging with the delay.

But why does the code check on 'bio->bi_vcnt == 1'? Once the bio is
submitted, .bi_vcnt isn't changed any more and merging doesn't change
it too. So should the check have been on blk_rq_bytes(rq)?

Mike, please correct me if my understanding is wrong.
