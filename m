Ext2 is not doing sub-block writes.

Generally, disks and SSDs do not guarantee 4k write atomicity (only disks 
with hardware 4k sector guarantee it).

For example, ext2 writes a full 4k block, only part of the block is 
written to the disk and then power failure happens. On the next reboot CBC 
will corrupt the unwritten part of the 4k block.
