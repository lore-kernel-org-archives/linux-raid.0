Well, if you want something with more than 2-block redundancy you need=20
something other than the existing RAID-6 code which, as you know, is a=20
special case of general Reed-Solomon coding that I happen to have spent=
=20
a lot of time optimizing.  The FEC code is not optimized at all if I ca=
n=20
tell, and certainly doesn't use SSE in any way -- never mind the GF=20
accelerators that are starting to appear.  That doesn't mean it=20
*couldn't*, just that noone has done the work to either implement it or=
=20
prove it can't be done.

Either way, perhaps the Plank paper that Rik pointed to could be useful=
=20
as a starting point; it's probably worth taking their performance=20
numbers with a *major* grain of salt: their implementation of RAID-6=20
"RS-Opt" which is supposed to be equivalent to my code performs at
400 MB/s, which is less than Pentium III-era performance of the real=20
world code (they compare not to real code but to their own=20
implementation in Java, called "Jerasure".)  Implementability using rea=
l=20
array instruction sets is key to decent performance.
