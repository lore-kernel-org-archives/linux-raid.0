This is exactly what I didn't in my first draft (bio_list -> bio_lists),
but then I reverted that change because it didn't seem to be worth the
noise.
It isn't much noise, sched.h, bcache/btree.c, md/dm-bufio.c, and
md/raid1.c get minor changes.
But as I'm hoping to get rid of all of those uses, renaming before
removing seemed pointless ... though admittedly that is what I did for
bioset_create().... I wondered about that too.

The example you give later:
	struct bio_list *tmp = current->bio_list;
	current->bio_list = NULL;
	submit_bio()
	current->bio_list = tmp;

won't cause any problem.  Whatever lists the parent generic_make_request
is holding onto will be untouched during the submit_bio() call, and will
be exactly as it expects them when this caller returns.

If some out-of-tree code does anything with ->bio_list that makes sense
with the previous code, then it will still make sense with the new
code. However there will be a few bios that it didn't get too look at.
These will all be bios that were submitted by a device further up the
stack (closer to the filesystem), so they *should* be irrelevant.
I could probably come up with some weird behaviour that might have
worked before but now wouldn't quite work the same way.  But just fixing
bugs can sometimes affect an out-of-tree driver in a strange way because
it was assuming those bugs.

I hope that I'll soon be able to remove punt_bios_to_rescuer and
flush_current_bio_list, after which current->bio_list  can really be
just a list again.  I don't think it is worth changing the name for a
transient situation.

But thanks for the review - it encouraged me to think though the
consequences again and I'm now more confident.
I actually now think that change probably wasn't necessary.  It is
safer though.  It ensures that current functionality isn't removed
without a clear justification.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
