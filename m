In your test, did you "fsync" the file after writing to it?  That is
essential for data security.
If fsync succeeded even though the data wasn't written, that is
certainly a bug.  If it doesn't succeed, then you know there is a
problem with your data.

I don't think the delay is relevant.
If writes are happening, then the kernel will get write error from the
failed devices and can flag the array as faulty.
If writes aren't happening, then it no important cost in the "device is
removed" message going up to user-space and back.
