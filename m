I don't think we can use md's existing bitmap support as there is no easy way
to store it on an arbitrary target:  it either lives near the metadata or on
a file (not a device).
There a just a few calls in the interface to md/bitmap.c - it shouldn't be
too hard to make those selectively call into a dm_dirty_log instead.
I want to do something like that anyway as I want to optionally be able to use
a dirty log which is a list of dirty sector addresses rather than a bitmap.
I'll have a look next week.

And the "bitmap chunk size" is exactly the same as the dm "region size".
(which would probably have been a better name to choose for md too).

I imagine enhancing the constructor to take before/after values for
type, disks, chunksize, and a sector which marks where "after" starts.
You also need to know which direction the reshape is going (low addresses to
high addresses, or the reverse) though that might be implicit in the other
values.

I haven't given cluster locking a lot of thought...
I would probably do the locking on a per-"stripe_head" basis as everything
revolves around that structure.
Get a shared lock when servicing a read (Which would only happen on a
degraded array - normally reads bypass the stripe cache), or a write lock
when servicing a write or a resync.
It should all interface with DLM quite well - when DLM tries to reclaim a lock
we first mark all the stripe as not up-to-date...

Does DM simply use DLM for locking or something else?
