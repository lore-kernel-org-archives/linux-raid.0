With the commit below the dm ioctl support was reordered so that the
target only had to identify the underlying device, the dm_blk_ioctl()
itself then applied those ioctls to the appropriate device:

    dm: refactor ioctl handling

However this also removed the possibility of a dm target having target
specific ioctls.  Currently this is not used by any in-tree targets but
was utilised by the flashcache out-of-tree module.

How would we feel about carrying something like the patch below in
mainline to allow for such target local ioctls.

Subject: dm: introduce a target_ioctl op to allow target specific ioctls

In e56f81e0b01e "dm: refactor ioctl handling" the target specific ioctl
operation was removed in favour of providing a mapping to the underlying
device, to which ioctls are all assumed to apply.  This prevents targets
from having target specific ioctls.

Introduce a new target_ioctl callback which (if present) is offered the
command and arguments for processing.  This callback can return -ENOTTY
to indicate the ioctl should be passed on to the underlying device as
normal.
