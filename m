Sorry, it's a mistake. I've resend one email to correct that with
'unsigned long'.

OK. I will modify that.

Yes, I need check the virtual contiguity.

OK. That's for some special usage. For example, the dm-crypt will send
one request mapped one scatterlist to engine level to handle the
request at one time. But we want to collect some requests together to
handle together at one time to improve engine efficiency. So in crypto
engine layer we need to copy the mapped scatterlists into one sg
table, which has been allocated some sg memory.

>  - how it works

The 'orig_nents' means how many scatterlists the sg table can hold.
The 'nents' means how many scatterlists have been copied into sg
table. So the 'nents' will be not equal as 'orig_nents' unless the sg
table is full.

I will not lost the number of mapped in sg table,  'nents' member
means how many mapped scatterlists in the dynamic table. Every time
one mapped sg copied into the dynamic table, the 'nents' will increase
1.
