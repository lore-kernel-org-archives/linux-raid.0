I was resizing from 4 TB to 6 TB, and during the time (okay, maybe it was j=
ust
an hour) I saw disk free space slowly increase at about 1 GB per couple of
seconds. RAID6 also was in a degraded state (one disk missing), so maybe
that's why it was slower than it should usually be.

Kernel version 2.6.38.2, cp (GNU coreutils) 8.5.

Also, what I didn't mention in my previous post, is that during that sessio=
n I
also had one E-Mail message which was just received by the mail client (not
copied from another disk via cp or otherwise) truncate too. The mail client=
 is
claws-mail and it stores individual messages on disk as regular files, a fi=
le
per message, and that one file was 0 bytes in size. At first I didn't think=
 it
was related, but it looks like all disk access is/was affected, not just
cp/coreutils.

Recently, as in "while on 2.6.38x kernels", or "in the past N minutes"?
Latter - definitely not (except for that one E-Mail mentioned above), forme=
r -
maybe, but unlikely.
