I realise that is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but I am certainly not
looking for someone who needs to be convinced, bribed, or shamed.
I'm hoping for someone who will weigh the pros and cons, decide this is
a contribution they are willing (and maybe even eager) to make, and will
step up and do so.
And I suspect that behind that facade of reluctance, that is what you
are really offering.  Thanks.

I propose to make one last release of mdadm either next week or the last
week of January.  I plan to call it "3.4" in acknowledgment of the new
cluster and raid5-journal functionality.
If you were to take it from there, I would be grateful.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
