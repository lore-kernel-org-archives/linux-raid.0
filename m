Please don't make a mountain out of a mole hill in an attempt to
defend your robotic patch (I'm quite tired of some of these static
analyzer patch submissions).

FYI, I did stage your other patch for 3.20, see:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-for-3.20&id=d0ce7e911c97c7c6df1081dcedfefced82a0c6bf

Efficiency isn't a concern in this instance (it isn't a hot IO path).
And even if it were, a branch (with current code) is more efficient vs
a a jump + branch (your proposed patch) -- in the case that no active
table exists.  Now if it likely that old_map does exist then yes your
patch is always a very slight win.

But given the duality of the calling function (deals with loading a
new map and destroying the old map if it exists) I prefer to keep the
code as is.  Sorry.
