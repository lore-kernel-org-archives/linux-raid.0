Hi

The GFP_NOIO allocation frees clean cached pages. The GFP_NOWAIT 
allocation doesn't. Your patch would incorrectly reuse buffers in a 
situation when the memory is filled with clean cached pages.

Here I'm proposing an alternate patch that first tries GFP_NOWAIT 
allocation, then drops the lock and tries GFP_NOIO allocation.

Note that the root cause why you are seeing this stacktrace is, that your 
block device is congested - i.e. there are too many requests in the 
device's queue - and note that fixing this wait won't fix the root cause 
(congested device).

The congestion limits are set in blk_queue_congestion_threshold to 7/8 to 
13/16 size of the nr_requests value.

If you don't want your device to report the congested status, you can 
increase /sys/block/<device>/queue/nr_requests - you should test if your 
chromebook is faster of slower with this setting increased. But note that 
this setting won't increase the IO-per-second of the device.

Subject: dm-bufio: drop the lock when doing GFP_NOIO alloaction

Drop the lock when doing GFP_NOIO alloaction beacuse the allocation can
take some time.

Note that we won't do GFP_NOIO allocation when we loop for the second
time, because the lock shouldn't be dropped between __wait_for_free_buffer
and __get_unclaimed_buffer.
