It clears the CPU caps whose xfeature dependencies are missing from the
given mask, which denotes the present xfeatures.  An empty mask means
nothing present, i.e. everything is missing.

It could be a separate function that clears unconditionally, but then
the clearing and the log messages would need to be duplicated.

I don't know what your suggestion is.  Are you still asking for the
function to be renamed to clear_cpu_caps_xft()?  Note that the
abbreviation "xft" doesn't appear anywhere else in arch/x86/.  Maybe you
want the argument inverted?  I don't know what you want, sorry.

The UML update is in this series.  See patch 2.  Maybe you don't care
about UML but many people do.  kunit.py uses it by default, for example.

This is basically what this patch does already:

	clear_cpu_caps_with_missing_xfeatures(fpu_kernel_cfg.max_features);

	fpu_kernel_cfg.independent_features = fpu_kernel_cfg.max_features &
					      XFEATURE_MASK_INDEPENDENT;

	/*
	 * Clear XSAVE features that are disabled in the normal CPUID.
	 */
	for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(xsave_cpuid_features); i++) {
		unsigned short cid = xsave_cpuid_features[i];

		/* Careful: X86_FEATURE_FPU is 0! */
		if ((i != XFEATURE_FP && !cid) || !boot_cpu_has(cid))
			fpu_kernel_cfg.max_features &= ~BIT_ULL(i);
	}

Maybe you want it moved down one statement so that it's immediately
adjacent to the loop?

Or maybe you want it to be integrated into the loop itself?  It's
doable, but a bit awkward because the two CPU features we'd like to
clear each depend on multiple xfeatures rather than just one.  And also
there are those two cases earlier in the function (XSAVE or FPU being
disabled) that do an early return and never reach here.  It's nice to
use the same helper function in those cases.

fpu__init_system_xstate() is already a function called once on the boot
CPU.  Is your suggestion that the feature clearing should be once per
CPU instead of just on the boot CPU?
