Some time ago I actually did test the patchset with the schedule_hrtimeout
removed, which I think is fairly close to what you've suggested.  As I recall,
it did help a bit, though not as much as also instituting the wait to limit the
% of disk execution time spent on flushes.  That said, I think you might be
right about the completion races, so I'll try to code up your suggestion to
see what happens with a newer kernel.
