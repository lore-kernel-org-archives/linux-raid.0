[Marri] Hello Greg, I am working on restructuring ppc4xx/adma.c driver
into
Common code and SoC specific code. This way I can add support for similar
DMA engines.
In this process I had to declare some Of the functions non static so that
I can suppress "defined but not used" and "used but not defined".


Here is what series of patches I planned to work on.

1. First set patches to re-arrange the code. Functionally no change except
Structured into different files.
2. Second set to rename the common functions which are shared between SoC
dma-engines.
3. Add support of new DMA engine for different SoC.

I am working on first patch set right now.


Regards,
Marri
