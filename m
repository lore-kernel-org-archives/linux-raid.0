fwiw one example use case is building a livecd or vm image from inside
container, on a system where each piece of functionality is
compartmentalized in a separate container.

For specific programs we can engineer them to call out to a helper
in the init user_ns, but that doesn't work for existing tools.

James Bottomley a year or two ago had mentioned the idea of using
seccomp to have the mount syscall in a container trap into a
init_user_ns helper, but we'd have to ptrace the whole container
for its whole lifetime to do that, or use SECCOMP_RET_TRAP with
a LD_PRELOAD that does goes through a proxy to do the remote
request (which becomes infeasible bc LD_PRELOAD won't stick).

If we did enable anything but FUSE I would hope each fs would have
a separate sysctl to enable non-init-userns mounts.  Then the admin
could enable them just as they do the automount of whatever garbage
is on a usb stick found lying on the trade floor.
