Agreed.

Yes, it should not be. But with less max_nr_stripes, the chance to get a
full strip write is less, and maybe that's the reason why the chance to
block at get_active_strip() is more; and also, the reading is more.

The perfect case would be there are no reading; setting max_nr_stripes
to 32768(the max we get set now), you will find the reading is quite
less(almost zero, please see the iostat I attached in former email).

Anyway, I do agree this should not be the big part of the solution. If
we can handle those stripes faster, I guess 256 would be enough.

Thanks,
