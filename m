Sounds reasonable... except that I have no clue how to trace that with
the limited means I have at my disposal right now and with the limited
knowledge I have of the kernel internals. ;-)

Is there any way to get a more detailed listing of where the memory is
spent while dd is running? Something I could pipe every 500ms or so for
later analysis or so?

Hm, okay. I am still confused though: If I, for example, let dd do the
exact same thing on a raw partition on the RAID10, nothing like that
happens. Wouldn't we have the same race and problem then too...? It is
only with dm-crypt in-between that all of this shows itself. But I do
somehow suspect the RAID10 Intel Rapid Storage to be the cause or at
least partially.

Like I said, if you have any pointers how I could further trace this
or figure out who is exactly consuming what memory, that would be very
helpful... Thanks.

So long,
Matthias
