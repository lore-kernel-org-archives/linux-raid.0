This is the commit I made to train DM to be numa node aware:
115485e83f497fdf9b4 ("dm: add 'dm_numa_node' module parameter")

As is the DM code is focused on memory allocations.  But I think blk-mq
may use the NUMA node for via tag_set->numa_node.  But that is moot
given pmem is bio-based right?

Steps could be taken to make all threads DM creates for a a given devic=
e
get pinned to the specified NUMA node too.
