Well, then it is not optimal for fs and should it be separated?
There is also /sys/fs now...

I think represent dependences of block devices in some generic (and exactly defined)
way is useful. So if there is something missing, lets define it properly.

The whole idea behind lsblk was practical: we responded many questions why
"device is busy" and what keeps it open in stacked subsystem.
Just try fdisk, mdadm, dmsetup table, losetup -a, kpartx, cryptsetup, etc ...

So listing block device tree using ONE interface (sysfs) to check and display
device tree for ALL subsystems seems to be good idea for me.
In this exactly defined case.

I am not saying that symlinks are perfect, just that generic interface here
is not superfluous.

Thanks,
Milan
