We still need the lock for __elv_add_request, so we'll need to keep the
logic anyway.  But splitting out the just queue to kblockd case from
__blk_run_queue and giving the latter a sane prototype still sounds
like a good idea to me.

Btw, now that we don't call the request_fn directly any more and thus
can't block, can the unplugging be moved into the preempt notifiers?
