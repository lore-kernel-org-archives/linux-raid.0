That would be quite easy to avoid.
Just call
   md_write_start()
before revalidate_disk, and
   md_write_end()
afterwards.
You wouldn't have a 'bio' to pass in - but it is rather ugly requiring
one anyway - I should fix that.
For testing, just pass in NULL, and change
	if (bio_data_dir(bi) != WRITE)
		return;
to
	if (bi && bio_data_dir(bi) != WRITE)
		return;
