Well, having the exact sector fixed is not mandatory, but really useful.
Better than nothing would be md logging that has fixed "something" and
it's location (a setor, a block, ....)
9 times out of 10 the dm-integrity log would be just above the md log,
so a match between dm-integrity sector and md block would be easy,
just read the line below or above.

I think that md should be a little bit more verbose on certain
actions. (in example, saying what was fixed, the last time of scrub
and it's result, as per my previous thread and so on)
