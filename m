Sorry, I am not understanding.

The current entry in MAINTAINERS is:
DEVICE-MAPPER  (LVM)
M:      Alasdair Kergon <agk@redhat.com>
M:      Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>
M:      dm-devel@redhat.com
L:      dm-devel@redhat.com
...

So my patch just removed the line : "M:      dm-devel@redhat.com"

So now the entry becomes :
DEVICE-MAPPER  (LVM)
M:      Alasdair Kergon <agk@redhat.com>
M:      Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>
L:      dm-devel@redhat.com
...

So, now it correctly shows dm-devel@redhat.com as a mailing list which 
should have cc to all the patches related to LVM.

Or am I understanding this wrong?
