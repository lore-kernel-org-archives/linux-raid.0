Properly initialize MD recovery flags when resuming device-mapper devices.

When a device-mapper device is suspended, all I/O must stop.  This is done by
calling 'md_stop_writes' and 'mddev_suspend'.  These calls in-turn manipulate
the recovery flags - including setting 'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN'.  The DM device
may have been suspended while recovery was not yet complete, so the process
needs to pick-up where it left off.  Since 'mddev_resume' does not unset
'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN' and set 'MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED', we must do it ourselves.
'MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED' can safely be set in 'mddev_resume', but 'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN'
must be set outside of 'mddev_resume' due to how MD handles RAID reshaping.
(e.g.  It is possible for a user to delay reshaping a RAID5->RAID6 by purposefully
setting 'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN'.  Clearing it in 'mddev_resume' would override the
desired behavior.)

Because 'mddev_resume' already unconditionally calls 'md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread)'
there is no need to make this call from 'raid_resume' since it calls 'mddev_resume'.
