Well, if there is a function pointer in the core suspend code initially=
 set to
NULL and exported to modules such that the dm-crypt code can set it to
something else, that should be sufficient, shouldn't it?

So if you're adding new PM notifier events, that's already more than *y=
ou* need.

Anyway, I guess the "post freeze" new one should be enough for now, but=
 please
change the name to POST_FREEZE.

Also I think we don't need separate "post freeze" events for suspend an=
d
hibernation.

Thanks,
Rafael
