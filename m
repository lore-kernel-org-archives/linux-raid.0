Wouldn't adopting a bulk request API (something like what I tried to
do here [1]) that allows users to supply multiple messages, each with
their own IV, fulfill this purpose? That way, we wouldn't need to
introduce any new modes into Crypto API and the drivers/accelerators
would only need to provide bulk implementations of common modes
(xts(aes), cbc(aes), ...) to provide better performance for dm-crypt
(and possibly other users, too).

I'm not sure how exactly these crypto accelerators work, but wouldn't
it help if the drivers simply get more messages (in our case sectors)
in a single call? I wonder, would (efficiently) supporting such a
scheme require changes in the HW itself or could it be achieved just
by modifying driver code (let's say specifically for your CryptoCell
accelerator)?

Thanks,
