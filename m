Don't worry, English is my first language. Have you tried with 
getmaintainer.pl and seen the result? It only shows dm-devel@redhat.com 
as a Maintainer and not as a list. (I noticed because I was sending a 
patch, and hence this patch again). But I believe a mailing list can not 
be a Maintainer ( have you seen any patch with a Signed-off-by: from a 
mailing list? ).
Anyway, I think this thread has become too long for an unimportant patch.
