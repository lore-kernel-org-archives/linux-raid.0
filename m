So it seems we have a couple of problems: the first being that
flush_disk() doesn't actually do what it says (flush the disk).  If it's
just discarding all data, dirty or clean, then its use in the
grow/shrink interface is definitely wrong.

The idea is that before we complete the grow/shrink, we make sure that
the device doesn't have any errors, so we want to try to write out all
dirty buffers to make sure they still have a home.  If flush_disk()
doesn't do that, then we need to use a different interface ... what's
the interface to flush a disk?
