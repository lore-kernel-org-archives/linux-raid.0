Now please put request-based dm-crypt completely to one side and focus
just on the existing bio-based code.  Why is it slower and what can be
adjusted to improve this?

People aren't going to take a request-based solution seriously until
you can explain in full detail *why* bio-based is slower AND why it's
impossible to improve its performance.

Bio-based also merges I/O so that does not provide justification.
Investigate in much more detail the actual merging and scheduling
involved in the cases you need to optimise.  See if blktrace gives you
any clues, or add your own instrumentation.  You could even look at some
of the patches we've had in the list archives for optimising bio-based
crypt in different situations.
