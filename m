Something like that is needed for some dm targets to support barriers.
(We needn't always wait for *all* in-flight I/O.)
When faced with -EOPNOTSUP, do all callers fall back to a sync in
the places a barrier would have been used, or are there any more
sophisticated strategies attempting to optimise code without barriers?

An efficient I/O barrier implementation would not normally involve
flushing AFAIK: dm surely wouldn't "cause" a higher layer to assume
stronger semantics than are provided.
