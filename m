Probably not as uncommon as you would think, but not as you suggest to raid thin 
provisioned luns (those are done usually as RAID devices inside an array).

Think more of the array providing a thinly provisioned LUN made up out of T13 
TRIM enabled SSD's devices internally.  RAID makes sense here (data protection 
is still needed to avoid a single point of failure) and the relative expense of 
the SSD's devices makes "thin provisioning" really attractive to external users :-)
