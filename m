Also, if you are going to add tight loops, you might want to put a
backoff in the loops like "congestion_wait(BLK_RW_ASYNC, HZ/50);" so
that they don't spin....

FWIW, in all this "allocations can't fail" churn, no one has noticed
that XFS has been doing these "allocations can't fail" loop in
kmem_alloc() and kmem_zone_alloc(), well, forever. I can't ever
remember seeing it report a potential deadlock, though....

Cheers,

Dave.
