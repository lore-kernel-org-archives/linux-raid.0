Your assessment is almost exactly what I had come up with, so it definitely
makes sense :-)
'destroy' does come very shortly after 'unregister' (and immediately before
'blk_put_queue' which actually frees the struct).  However the driving force
for this patch was a desire to move blk_cleanup_queue(), which calls
'destroy', earlier.  So the net result is that bdi_set_min_ratio will be
called slightly sooner.

Thanks,
