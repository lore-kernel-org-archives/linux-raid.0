Hi all,
 following are some md fixes for -rc2 that I will be sending to Linus
 (hopefully) for -rc3.

 Most are for raid5 and many of those are fixes for the new
 batched-stripe-writes code.
 Sorry Shaohua, I didn't review/test those properly before forwarding
 them on.  Could you please check them all and make sure there is
 nothing that you disagree with.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
