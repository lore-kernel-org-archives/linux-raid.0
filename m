The first target is fuse, which won't be vulnerable to those attacks.

Shortly after that I plan to follow with support for ext4. I've been
fuzzing ext4 for a while now and it has held up well, and I'm currently
working on hand-crafted attacks. Ted has commented privately (to others,
not to me personally) that he will fix bugs for such attacks, though I
haven't seen any public comments to that effect.
