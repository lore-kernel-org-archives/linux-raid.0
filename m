Hey,

Well, that's what it does:

# $ dd if=/dev/mapper/vg0-home_crypt of=/dev/zero iflag=direct bs=8k count=131072 seek=131072
# 131072+0 records in
# 131072+0 records out

For this test, I'm not doing dio on filesystem level, but on block level
(/dev/mapper/vg0-*_crypt). It seems that dm-crypt creates such offending
holes, which cause this huge performance drop.

With this fix, I get proper speeds when doing dio reads from
/dev/mapper/vg0-*_crypt; see the 17.3 MB/s above. Most strangely,
also accesing /dev/mapper/vg0-* (un-encrypted) and the raw
device at /dev/sda* speeds up (to up to 28 MB/s). Was only seeing around
16 to 18 MB/s without this patch for unencrypted access.

Well, it seems to cause -- at least on my notebook -- a 150% regression on
unencrypted LVM2 access; and this > 400% on encrypted LVM2 access...

There is, probably. But the fix you propose helps a lot, already.

Thanks & best,
