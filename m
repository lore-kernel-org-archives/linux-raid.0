But now many vendors supply the hardware engine to handle the
encyrtion/decryption. The hardware really need a big block to indicate
its performance with request based things. Another thing is now the
request based things is used by many vendors (Qualcomm, Spreadtrum and
so on) to improve their performance and there's a real performance
requirement here (I can show the performance result later).

I don't think you will worry if any one can work properly, we will
remove the bio based things in future if the request things are
accepted and proved effectively. Thanks for your comment.
