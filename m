It is because the the crypto lookup api sees that the crypto algorithm is in
a LARVAL state and registers a new instance every time by invoking the
".create" callback. I guess it should be solved by adding test data to
testmgr.

Do you have some real performance numbers that proves that such a patch is

While waiting to do some implementation of the hw crypto drivers to work
with
dm-crypt, I'll also generate some numbers to compare the performance with
the
original dm-crypt code with the new one with a software implementation in
place.

I think it should work for everyone (even for ciphers not supporting IVs)
if the null IV
mode is used. It should be upto the IV generation template to choose to
generate IV
or just call the underlying (base) template/cipher.
