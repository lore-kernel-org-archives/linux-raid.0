The idea is that ALL block devices will support barriers; if the 
underlying driver doesn't, then the block layer will work around it.

Barrier != synchronous write, so if XFS relies on that block being on 
the media when the request is completed, then it is broken.  It should 
only care that the ordering of log-data-log is maintained, not exactly 
when each specific request completes.
