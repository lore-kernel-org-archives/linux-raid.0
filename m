I've had a look and I must say I'm not sure either.
I keep wondering if something is wrong with the locking in get_active_strip=
e.
The region covered by device_lock is not much smaller with the whole now
covered by hash_locks[hash].  I cannot see a problem with the locking but I
might be missing something.  A missing atomic_inc of active_stripes in there
could cause your problem.

As you can easily reproduce, could you try expanding the range covered by
device_lock to be the whole branch where sh is not NULL.  If that makes a
difference it would be quite instructive.  I don't hold high hopes though.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
