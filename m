Just as a note:  the name is a complete misowner, a couple overwrite
are not in any way secure deletion.  So naming it this way and exposing
this as erase is a problem that is going to get back to bite us.

If you really want this anyway at least give it a different way, and
do a one-time warning when th first erase comes in that it is not in
any meaninful way secure.
