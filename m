Is it "much" or "no"?
Would it be reasonable to use this for reads from a non-degraded
raid1?  What about writes?

What I would really like is some clarification on what sort of errors
get retried, how often, and how much timeout there is..

And does the 'error' code returned in ->bi_end_io allow us to
differentiate media errors from other errors yet?

Yes, this one is pretty straight forward.. I mentioned it more as a
reminder to my self that I really should support it in raid5 :-(
