Instead of selecting
ASYNC_TX_ENABLE_CHANNEL_SWITCH,
we can select the following in BCM_SBA_RAID config
option:
1. ASYNC_TX_DISABLE_XOR_VAL
2. ASYNC_TX_DISABLE_PQ_VAL

This will satisfy the needs of
dma_async_device_register() when
ASYNC_TX_ENABLE_CHANNEL_SWITCH is
not selected.

Will this be acceptable ??
