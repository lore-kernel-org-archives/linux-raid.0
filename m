Looks good overall.

Could you please document why it is OK to remove 'flush_error' in the
patch header?  The -EOPNOTSUPP handling removal (done in patch 2)
obviously helps enable this but it is not clear how the
'num_flush_requests' flushes that __clone_and_map_flush() generates do
not need explicit DM error handling.

Other than that.
