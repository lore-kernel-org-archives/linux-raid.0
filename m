No.  I think the issue is very sensitive to the exact placement of the =
border
between the two dm targets.  You need to be able to produce a flush req=
uest
that crosses that border.

So to reproduce it I would:

 Create an ext4 filesystem of some known size.
 Impose some simple easily reproducible load and use e.g. blktrace to g=
ets a
 log of the flush requests.
 Choose on such request that is larger than a sector and note it's loca=
tion
 Create a DM device of the same size with two targets on md devices whe=
re the
 first target ends in the middle of where the flush request was
 Repeat the above sequence on the dm device.  That should result in a f=
lush
 request overlapping both targets and thus triggering the issue.
