Just few notes...

The lmk (loopAES) and tcw (old TrueCrypt mode) IVs are in fact hacks,
it is combination of IV and modification of CBC mode (in post calls).

It is used only in these disk-encryption systems, it does not make sense
to use it elsewhere (moreover tcw IV is not safe, it is here only
for compatibility reasons).

I think that IV generators should not modify or read encrypted data directly,
it should only generate IV.

By the move everything to cryptoAPI we are basically introducing some strange mix
of IV and modes there, I wonder how this is going to be maintained.
Anyway, Herbert should say if it is ok...

But I would imagine that cryptoAPI should implement only "real" IV generators
and these disk-encryption add-ons keep inside dmcrypt.
(and dmcrypt should probably use normal IVs through crypto API and
build some wrapper around for hacks...)

I really do not think the disk encryption key management should be moved
outside of dm-crypt. We cannot then change key structure later easily.

But it is not only key management, you are basically moving much more internals
outside of dm-crypt:

^^^ these key sizes you probably mean by key management.
It is based on way how the key is currently sent into kernel
(one hexa string in ioctl that needs to be split) and have to be changed in future.
