At this point we've actually implemented the fundamental parts of
RAID[56] support in btrfs, and it's looking like all we really want is
the arithmetic routines.

Perhaps that's because I'm insufficiently familiar with the
handle_stripe() function to which you refer. Would you like to take to
take a look at http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/btrfs-raid56.git and
attempt to convince me that I should be reusing more?

Criticism in 'diff -up' form is always welcome... :)
