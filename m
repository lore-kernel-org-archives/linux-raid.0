Bio error reporting has been a mess for a while, and the increasing
use of chained bios makes it worse.

This series attempts to add a proper error field to struct bio
to sort this out.  It's working fine for me, but MD and btrfs were
doing pretty nasty things with the BIO_UPTODATE flag, so I would
appreciate some detailed review there.
