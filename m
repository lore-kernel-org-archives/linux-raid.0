Song, thanks for the suggestions. I've been working in the refactor, so
far it's working fine. But I cannot re-add a member to raid0/linear
without performing a full stop (with "mdadm --stop"), and in this case
md_clean() will clear the flag. Restarting array this way works fine.

If I try writing 'inactive' to array_state, I cannot reinsert the member
to the array. That said, I don't think we need to worry in clearing
MD_BROKEN for RAID0/LINEAR, and it makes things far easier.
Are you ok with that? I'll submit V3 after our discussion.

Thanks,


Guilherme
