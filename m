I'm pretty happy with this patchset at this point, looks like it just
needs a respin to address the last comments. My only concern is whether
it's a good idea to target this for 4.21, or if we should wait until
4.22. 4.21 has a fairly substantial amount of changes in terms of block
already, it's not the best timing for something of this magnitude too.

I'm going back and forth on those one a bit. Any concerns with
pushing this to 4.22?
