Nearly two months ago I posted my first serious attempt and making
md/raid5.c work as a dm target.  I met with cautious approval I think,
but as it didn't interact with dirty-logs yet it wasn't really read
for prime time.

It has taken longer than I hoped, but here is version 2, now with
dirty-log integration.
I have done a modest amount of testing, watching the bits in the log
getting cleared and set just as you would expect, and watching the
resync complete instantly when the dirty-log shows that all regions
are clean.

There is not even a hint of cluster support yet, but that shouldn't be
necessary for initial submission to mainline.

A significant difference to Heinz' dm-raid45 is that I only honour the
table options that lvm actually sets.  The extra ones don't really fit
with md/raid5 and I don't think they need to be table options.  If any
are needed they might work OK as messages (???).

There are a number of changes to core-dm in here including:
  - support for targets to be unplugged when the device is
  - support for targets to report congestion beyond the congestion
    of component devices
  - support for the dirty-log to cover and extent different from the
    size of the target (For raid5 it must be the size of the
    components).
I have tried to fit these to the general style of dm as best as I can.

There is certainly room for more testing and review, but I would like
to see this entering -next soon with a view to seeing it merged in the
next merge window.

Is this reasonable?  Achievable?

Comments?

These patches can all be found on the "md-dm-raid45" branch of
   git://neil.brown.name/md/
or at http://neil.brown.name/git?p=md;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/md-dm-raid45


Thanks,
