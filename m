You are right, of course. I did not take that into account.

I guess there is a question if it really is important to know that
your request ended up
on the backlog, rather than being handled.I can imagine it can be used
as back pressure
indication but I wonder if someone is using that.

If not, maybe we can simplify things and use EINPROGRESS asindication
of a request
being accepted by the next layer (either being processed or queued in
the back log), whereas
EBUSY would indicate failure.

It does have a potential to make things simpler, I think.
