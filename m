Please send think in this area through -fsdevel next time, thanks!

Does it?  If the device has disappeared we can't read them back anyway.
If the device has resized to a smaller size the same is true about
those buffers that have gone away, and if it has resized to a larger
size invalidating anything doesn't make sense at all.  I think this
area needs more love than a quick kill_dirty hackjob.

Doing anything like this at the buffer cache layer or inode cache layer
doesn't make any sense.  If a device goes away or shrinks below the
filesystem size the filesystem simply needs to be shut down and in te
former size the admin needs to start a manual repair.  Trying to do
any botch jobs in lower layer never works in practice.

For now I think the best short term fix is to simply revert commit
608aeef17a91747d6303de4df5e2c2e6899a95e8

	"Call flush_disk() after detecting an online resize."
