How would the pure storage server in question send data out to client systems?  
SMB?  NFS?  IMAP?  All options will take some CPU power.

There's a common myth that people should use hardware RAID to save CPU time, 
that's obviously wrong in the case of RAID-1 (just writing the data twice) and 
RAID-5 (XOR for parity).  But as we get into the more complex forms of parity 
CPU performance could become an issue.

Of course in terms of overall system performance the cost of doing a RAID 
rebuild in terms of disk seeks will probably exceed the CPU use.  As an aside, 
are there plans to limit the RAID rebuild speed for BTRFS?

Traditionally SCSI/SAS disks have tended to be a lot smaller than IDE/SATA 
disks.  Now Dell has just started offering 2TB SAS disks while the largest SATA 
disks that they sell (In Australia on PowerEdge T110 servers at least) are 
also 2TB.  Presumably RAID recovery time was one factor that made 
manufacturers not bother with making larger SCSI/SAS disks in the past.

When 20TB disks become available a user could choose to just use the first 10TB 
of the disk.  Even in the days when 40G disks were big some people would use 
less than the full capacity of the disk for performance.

Will people really be storing data that is so important that triple parity is 
needed on 20TB disks but be unable to afford enough disks to use only the first 
10TB of each disk?  Is this a use-case that is worth coding for?
