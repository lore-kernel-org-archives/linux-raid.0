Well, hello there,

Posted it on linux-kernel ML also, and post it here, for more specific anal=
ysis.

I faced this problem today while trying to mount some NFS share on OpenBSD =
box.
I mounted it successfully without any visible errors, but I wasn't able to =
cd there, the printed error was:

ksh: cd: /storage - Stale NFS file handle

Apropos, the partition is 5.5 TB. I tried another one on my box and it was =
mounted successfully. It was possible to manage files there too. Its size i=
s ~3GB.
That's why the first time I thought about some size limitations of OpenBSD/=
Linux/NFS.

While talking on #openbsd @ freenode, I discovered this via tcpdump on both=
 sides:

http://pastebin.ca/1864713

Googling for 3 hours didn't help at all, some posts had similiar issue but =
either with no answer at all or without any full description.

Then I started to experiment with another Linux box to kill the possible di=
fferent variants.

On another box I also have nfs-utils 1.1.6 and kernel 2.6.32. Mounting that=
 big partition was unsuccessful, it got just stuck. On tcpdump I've seen th=
is:

familiar messages, eh?

Since that time I've solved that's not OpenBSD problem. So only NFS and Lin=
ux left as the reasons of this.
It was possible to mount that small partition on Linux box too, the same as=
 on OpenBSD.

But afterthat I recongnized an interesting issue: I have different sw raid =
setups on my storage server.
I tried to mount a small partition on the same md device where 5.5TB partit=
ion is located, and got the same
error message! Now I'm sure it's about NFS <-> MDADM setup, that's why I ca=
lled the topic like this.

A bit about my setup:

# cat /proc/mdstat=20
Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [multipath=
]=20
md3 : active raid1 sdc1[0] sdd1[1]

     =20
md1 : active raid5 sdc2[2] sdd2[3] sdb2[1] sda2[0]
      3153408 blocks level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]

md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
      61376 blocks [2/2] [UU]
     =20
unused devices: <none>

md0, md1, and md3 aren't so interesting, since fs is created directly on th=
em, and that's a _problem device_:

It's very handy partitioning scheme where I can extend (grow 5th raid) with=
 more hdds only /vault partition while "loosing" (a.k.a. not using for this=
 partition) only ~1gb of space from every 2TB drive.

System boots ok and xfs_check passes with no problems, etc.
The only problem: it's not possible to use NFS shares on any partition of /=
dev/md2 device.

Finally, my question to NFS and MDADM developers: any idea?
