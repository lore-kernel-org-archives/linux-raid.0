That would require a licensing change for the kernel. The kernel is a GPL
work. Some of us have not licensed it in any other way.

The _GPL is meant to make it clear they are internal symbols. The lack of
an _GPL does not make them usable by non GPL code, it merely indicates
that its perhaps more likely that you could in some cases shown something
was not a derivative work.

The licensing is determined by the license document, and that very
clearly says the boundary is derivative works. The rest is just vague
guidance.

In addition btw please be careful when trying to do this even with non
derivative code your lawyer is happy with. The kernel contains algorithms
which are subject to various US software patent mess where GPL use has
been granted, that may impact you if you use such code indirectly in non
GPL code.
