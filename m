Thank you for the suggestion. I spent part of yesterday experimenting 
with this idea, and it is certainly very promising. However, it does 
have some disadvantages as compared to dm-bow, if I am understanding the 
setup correctly:

1) Since dm-snap has no concept of the free space on the underlying file 
system any write into the free space will trigger a backup, so using 
twice the space of dm-bow. Changing existing data will create a backup 
with both drivers, but since we have to reserve the space for the 
backups up-front with dm-snap, we would likely only have half the space 
for that. Either way, it seems that dm-bow is likely to double the 
amount of changes we could make.

(Might it be possible to dynamically resize the backup file if it is 
mostly used up? This would fix the problem of only having half the space 
for changing existing data. The documentation seems to indicate that you 
can increase the size of the snapshot partition, and it seems like it 
should be possible to grow the underlying file without triggering a lot 
of writes. OTOH this would have to happen in userspace which creates 
other issues.)

2) Similarly, since writes into free space do not trigger a backup in 
dm-bow, dm-bow is likely to have a lower performance overhead in many 
circumstances. On the flip side, dm-bow's backup is in free space and 
will collide with other writes, so this advantage will reduce as free 
space fills up. But by choosing a suitable algorithm for how we use free 
space we might be able to retain most of this advantage.

I intend to put together a fully working prototype of your suggestion 
next to better compare with dm-bow. But I do believe there is value in 
tracking free space and utilizing it in any such solution.
