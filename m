I would assume so.
because if current is blocked for any reason,
it will dispatch all bios that are still on current->bio_list
to be processed from other contexts.

Which means we will not deadlock, but make progress,
if the unblock of current depends on processing of those bios.

Also see my other mail on the issue,
where I try to better explain the mechanics of "my" deadlock.
