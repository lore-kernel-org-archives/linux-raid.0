The short answer is that we'll definitely want to use the async code
where it is available.  Btrfs is already wired up to hand off CPU
intensive parts of IO submission (compression, checksumming) to helper
threads.  There's some extra ordering so that we can have N threads
checksumming but still send down the actual bios in the proper order.

Once the btrfs raid5/6 is working well, I'll wire it into the helper
threads as well.  Are the raid offload engines fast enough that we won't
want the helper threads when they are available?
