The commit that fixed the problem was:
f466722ca614edcd14f3337373f33132117c7612
f466722 md: Change handling of save_raid_disk and metadata update during recover

I don't know if this is safe to independently apply to previous kernels or not yet.  Neil, do you know?

I have applied it directly to the 3.13 kernel and it solves the problem.  However, applying it to the 3.12 kernel does not solve the problem.  There is obviously something else I'm missing or the fuzziness of the patch on 3.12 is causing things to not behave as expected.
