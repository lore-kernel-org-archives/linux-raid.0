If you aren't running a 32-bit system with this config, you shouldn't
really care.  For those systems that need to run in this mode they
would rather have it work a few percent slower instead of not at all.

The e2fsck code is currently just starting to get > 16TB support,
and while the initial implementation is naive, we are definitely
planning on reducing the memory needed to check very large devices.

The last test numbers I saw were 5GB of RAM for a 20TB filesystem,
but since the bitmaps used are fully-allocated arrays that isn't
surprising.  We are planning to replace this with a tree, since the
majority of bitmaps used by e2fsck have large contiguous ranges of
set or unset bits and can be represented much more efficiently.

I'm guessing that such systems won't have a 20TB boot device, but
rather a small flash boot/swap device (a few GB is cheap) and then
they could swap, if strictly necessary.

Also, for filesystems like btrfs or ZFS the checking can be done
online and incrementally without storing a full representation of
the state in memory.
