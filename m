Yes. Because (I guess M stands for maintainer) this list has maintainer
status. As all patches should be sent to the maintainers therefore all
patches should be sent to this list.

The same person can appear twice in a phone book, once under their name
and once under their job title. This is exactly the same situation -
this list should appear once as a list to tell people that it's a list,
AND ALSO as a maintainer to tell people that patches must be sent to the
list.

I guess English is not your first language, but the important point is
that M and L are not mutually exclusive.

Cheers,
