You should talk with Ilya, who is working on replacing failed raid drives as
well.

Agree with Josef here, change the code to record which one was used.
The current bio submission stuff only keeps the btrfs_multi_bio struct
around when a given IO spans more than one disk.  But you can easily
change it to keep the struct around for all IOs.

Currently the block size is always smaller than the stripe size.  But
you have a good point.

In the initial implementation sure, but long term it's not the best.

Sorry, I'd rather not overwrite the copy we know to be good.
