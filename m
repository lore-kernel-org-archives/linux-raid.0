Hi Bob, I understand that all other levels have fault-tolerance logic,
while raid0 is just a "bypass" driver that selects the correct
underlying device to send the BIO and blindly sends it. It's known to be
a performance-only /lightweight solution whereas the other levels aim to
be reliable.

I've quickly tested raid5 and rai10, and see messages like this on
kernel log when removing a device (in raid5):

[35.764975] md/raid:md0: Disk failure on nvme1n1, disabling device.
md/raid:md0: Operation continuing on 1 devices.

The message seen in raid10 is basically the same. As a (cheap)
comparison of the complexity among levels, look that:

<...>/linux-mainline/drivers/md# cat raid5* | wc -l
14191

<...>/linux-mainline/drivers/md# cat raid10* | wc -l
5135

<...>/linux-mainline/drivers/md# cat raid0* | wc -l
820

Cheers,


Guilherme
