AFAIK, this was the main change needed. Change the syntax and plumb
into the ioctl interface. The discussion ended with Mike being open to
the idea, and for me to go work on it. I haven't had time to work on
it, though, so it has continued to be a locally carried patch:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-February/msg00199.html

More recently David Zeuthen has been poking at this code, so I've
included him on CC here, in case there are new developments.
