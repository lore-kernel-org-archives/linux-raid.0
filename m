The online resize shouldn't take more than a few minutes, unless the disk is crazy busy and you are going from 16GB to 16TB or something.

This does nothing more than set a field in the superblock, and it only gives a hint to the allocator to align the files on multiples of 48-block boundaries.

What kernel version do you have, and what version of coreutils?  Is this perhaps a bleeding-edge kernel/coreutils with the "FIEMAP" bug?

Were the source files that had problems recently written themselves in this case?
