Copying the data would be performance overkill. You can really write 
different data to different disks, you just must not forget to resync them 
after a crash. The filesystem/application will recover with either old or 
new data --- it just won't recover when it's reading old and new data from 
the same location.

From my point of view that trick with thread doing sync() and turning off 
region bits looks best. I'd like to know if that solution doesn't have any 
other flaw.

fsync already works this way.
