Yes, please, if possible, go for a permanent udev rule surely - this
will make it much easier for other foreign tools to hook in properly if
needed and it would also be much easier to debug.

But, wouldn't it be better if we could just pass this information ("not
initialized yet") as RUN_ARRAY md ioctl parameter? In that case the md
driver in kernel could add the variable to the uevent it generates which
userspace udev rules could check for easily. This way, we don't need to
hassle with creating files in filesystem and the information would be
directly a part of the uevent the md kernel driver generates (so
directly accessible in udev rules too). Also, possibly adding more
variables for other future scenarios if needed.

We use something similar in device-mapper already where we pass flags
(besides other things) as a device-mapper ioctl parameter which then
gets into the uevent as DM_COOKIE uevent variable (which in turn the
udev rules can decode into individual flags). This method proved to be
working well for us to solve the problem of uninitialized data area so
we don't get into trouble with scans from udev (see also dm_ioctl
structure in usr/include/linux/dm-ioctl.h and the dm_kobject_uevent
function in drivers/md/dm.c for the kernel part; in udev rules the flags
are then various DM_UDEV_* variables we check for)
