Hi,

Thanks for answer.

So this is just doing some kind of batch processing optimization inside the driver?
I still do not understand why it is not possible to "batch" these requests inside
you driver (with async API) then and process them in one go without any changes
to dmcrypt though. (But I am not familiar with these drivers.)

If I understand it correctly, subsequent IVs are calculated inside
your driver just based on some initial value?
This can work only for sequential IVs (or, better said, for predictable
IVs like plain64, implemented inside your hw/driver).

It cannot work for IVs/tweaks that are randomized or keyed (like ESSIV).
Yes, I know that using ESSIV for XTS is considered overkill but I do not
see you are checking this condition anywhere in code (we can definitely
configure such a mapping).

I do not care about implementation details, I just would like to see
some high-level description for the new API flag.
(Or at least read the code that implements it :)

I think if you introduce new flag, you should also post drivers that uses it.
Otherwise it is just unused code for mainline.

And I definitely would like to test it somewhere and see real
performance data (not just simple dd).

Thanks,
Milan
