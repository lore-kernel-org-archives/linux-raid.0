dm_softirq_done()
    rq_completed()
        blk_run_queue()
            dm_request_fn()
                dm_dispatch_request()
                    blk_insert_cloned_request()
                        __elv_add_request()
                            elv_insert()
                                blk_run_queue()
                                    ...

Basically you recurse back into the request handler, since it ends up
running the queue. But I see I've been too focused on the older release,
since we don't actually do that anymore after the plugging rewrite. So
it should actually be safe in current kernels and hence the patch only
needed for the stable series where that is not the case.
