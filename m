I see three possible solutions:
 - integrate 'secdel' into dm-linear;
 - export functions like linear_dax_copy_to_iter and fill them into
   secdel's `struct target_type`;
 - call methods of linear's `struct target_type` from secdel's one.

Yes, but we need to create and write random data, so I don't see other
solution. In zero overwriting mode page is not allocated. And it's fall
back to zero overwriting if page allocation fails for random data.

I will address these and other your concerns in v2.

Thanks!
