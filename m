The /dev/mmcblk0 device is congested. You can see the number of requests 
in /sys/block/mmcblk0/inflight

The eMMC has some IOPS and the IOPS can't be improved. Use faster block 
device - but it will cost more money.

If you want to handle such a situation where you run 4 tasks each eating 
900MB, just use more memory, don't expect that this will work smoothly on 
4GB machine.

If you want to protect the chromebook from runaway memory allocations, you 
can detect this situation in some watchdog process and either kill the 
process that consumes most memory with the kill syscall or trigger the 
kernel OOM killer by writing 'f' to /proc/sysrq-trigger.

The question is what you really want - handle this situation smoothly 
(then, you must add more memory) or protect chromeOS from applications 
allocating too much memory?
