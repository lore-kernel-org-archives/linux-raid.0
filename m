Device-Mapper's "asm-striped" target is used to create a striped (i.e. RAID-0)
device across one or more underlying devices. Data is written in "chunks",
with consecutive chunks rotating among the underlying devices. This can
potentially provide improved I/O throughput by utilizing several physical
devices in parallel. However, in order to gain maximum I/O performance
between slow and fast device, there is a ratio to set up the chunk size
among these device.

Parameters: <num devs> <chunk size> <ratio> [<dev path> <offset>]+
<num devs>: Number of underlying devices.
<chunk size>: Size of each chunk of data. Must be at least as
large as the system's PAGE_SIZE.
<ratio>: The proportion of per io size, it is the times as much
as 1 chunk size
<dev path>: Full pathname to the underlying block-device, or a
"major:minor" device-number.
<offset>: Starting sector within the device.
