But the system was left in a crash consistent state.  Properly written
apps will wait for I/O to ensure data loss (in the event of a failed
resume) isn't a problem.

disks are already synced as part of the DM suspend operation!

But you're saying that all user processes are frozen (and associated
I/O flushed) before the DM suspend, that is different:

I just don't think that extreme is _required_ to have a hibernate/resum=
e
that incorporates dm-crypt key wiping.
