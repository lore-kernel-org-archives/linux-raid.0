I think you are too optimistic about ideal world...
"Properly written apps" "ensure data loss"

Yes, but part of hibernate operation is also sync call.

Yes, I want to ensure that. So processes wont be able to do any other
I/O.

Ok, and what other developers think?

I'm saying that if I want to wipe luks keys before suspend/hibernate an=
d
have system in consistant state as much as possible, keys must be wiped
*after* userspace processes are freezed. Or do you have relevant or
functional argument why not? Or is there any problem in my thinking?
