Thought we were talking about high-end storage stuff.  I don't think
I'll be too uncomfortable.  The reason why we're talking about this at
all is because high-end stuff with fancy NV cache and a hunk of battery
will unnecessarily suffer from the current barrier implementation.

SCSI NV bit or report write through cache?  Again, we're talking about
large arrays and we already trust the write through thing even on cheap
single spindle drives.  sd currently doesn't honor NV bit and it's
causing some troubles on some arrays.  We'll probably have to honor them
at least conditionally.
