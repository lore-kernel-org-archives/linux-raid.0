Certainly it would be good to give the user more information.  If you
can tell the user where the errors are, and what the likely failed block
is, then that would be very useful.  If you can tell where it is in the
filesystem (such as which file, if any, owns the blocks in question)
then that would be even better.

If this can all be done to give the user an informed choice, then it
sounds good.

One issue here is whether the check should be done with the filesystem
mounted and in use, or only off-line.  If it is off-line then it will
mean a long down-time while the array is checked - but if it is online,
then there is the risk of confusing the filesystem and caches by
changing the data.

(I know you know how this works, so I am not trying to be patronising
with this explanation - I just think we have slightly misunderstood what
the other is saying, so spelling it out will hopefully make it clearer.)

Most disk errors /are/ detectable, and are reported by the underlying
hardware - small surface errors are corrected by the disk's own error
checking and correcting mechanisms, and larger errors are usually
detected.  It is (or should be!) very rare that a read error goes
undetected without there being a major problem with the disk controller.
 And if the error is detected, then the normal raid processing kicks in
as there is no doubt about which block has problems.

If you can be /sure/ about which data block is incorrect, then I agree -
but you can't be /entirely/ sure.  But I agree that you can make a good
enough guess to recommend a fix to the user - as long as it is not
automatic.

For most ECC schemes, you know that all your blocks are set
synchronously - so any block that does not fit in, is an error.  With
raid, it could also be that a stripe is only partly written - you can
have two different valid sets of data mixed to give an inconsistent
stripe, without any good way of telling what consistent data is the best
choice.

Perhaps a checking tool can take advantage of a write-intent bitmap (if
there is one) so that it knows if an inconsistent stripe is partly
updated or the result of a disk error.
