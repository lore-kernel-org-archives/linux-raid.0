OK, I misunderstood your question though. You were mentioning the direct
IO earlier so I thought you were referring to it here as well.

Yes they are.

Those are submitted for the IO. dm-crypt will allocate a "shadow" page
for each of them to perform the encryption and only then submit the IO
to the storage underneath see

You need to have a kernel with CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS and then enable them
via debugfs. You are interested in kmalloc tracepoint and specify a size
as a filter to only see those that are really interesting. I haven't
checked your slabinfo yet - hope to get to it later today.
