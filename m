Yes, I see.  I'm use to seeing positional parameter in dm tables and didn't
process properly that these are key/value parameters.

OK... though 'resync' and 'rebuild' are very different things and should not
be confused.  So the [no]sync option should not affect rebuild of new devices.

No, I think you've address it all.

Fair enough.

Famous last words!!!

When reshaping a RAID5/6 to change the chunk size or layout, or when
converting an N drive RAID5 to N+1 drive RAID6, it makes it a lot easier if
you can can change the data offset at the same time.  Then you don't have to
keep backing up data.  md cannot do this yet but I hope to add the code soon
and because 'data_offset' is a distinct value it is conceptually easy to do.
If 'data_offset' is assumed to be zero, then it isn't.

But I don't know to what extent you are planning on supporting reshaping of
arrays....

Thanks,

NeilBrown
