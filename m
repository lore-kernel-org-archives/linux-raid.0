Readable or not, the code with the != is _not_ future-proof.  Whereas
Andy's solution is.  If/when a new compat feature comes along then
FEATURE_FLAG_SUPPORTS_V190 would be replaced to be a macro that ORs all
the new compat features together (e.g. FEATURE_FLAG_COMPAT).  E.g. how
dm-thin-metadata.c:__check_incompat_features() does.

We can go with the != code for now, since any future changes would
likely cause this test to be changed.  Or we could fix it now _for
real_.
