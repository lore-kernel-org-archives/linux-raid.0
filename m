Much better.

I ran some test on our combined trees over the weekend and tripped a bug
on some SCSI configs. Turned out to be my fault so I'll repost with a
fixed patch 2.

You can either rebase on top of the new series or maybe Jens will merge
my patches first. Either way works for me.

In any case I'm OK with your latest changes. Feel free to add my
Acked-by.
