Thanks for these.
I see they were mainly on linux-ide and linux-scsi, neither of which I
read.  They also eventually made an appearance on linux-kernel, but it
is only by luck that I find important stuff there.

Yes, I have been aware of it for a while but had my mind on other
things and figured other people could probably get the details right
without me interfering....

Thanks for this - quite helpful.  I might refer to bit in my reply to
Martin.

Oh yuck.  I wasn't aware of that.  This is just horrible.

please please please please please!

(I haven't really paid attention, but I thought everything always had
 a 'queue' - I just ignored in on md devices because it didn't mean
 anything).
