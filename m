The patch was labored over for quite a while and is based on suggestions I
got from Jens when discussing a very problematic aspect of old
.request_fn request-based DM performance for a multi-threaded (64
threads) sequential IO benchmark (vdbench IIRC).  The issue was reported
by NetApp.

The patch in question fixed the lack of merging that was seen with this
interleaved sequential IO benchmark.  The lack of merging was made worse
if a DM multipath device had more underlying paths (e.g. 4 instead of 2).

As for your question, about using blk_rq_bytes(rq) vs 'bio->bi_vcnt == 1'
.. not sure how that would be a suitable replacement.  But it has been a
while since I've delved into these block core merge details of old
.request_fn but _please_ don't change the logic of this code simply
because it is proving itself to be problematic for your current
patchset's cleanliness.

Mike
