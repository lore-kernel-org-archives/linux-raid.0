Why is it not the job of the block layer to translate for broken devices 
and send them a flush/write/flush?

The device mapper keeps track of in flight requests already.  When 
switching tables it has to hold new requests and wait for in flight 
requests to complete before switching to the new table.  When it gets a 
barrier request it just needs to do the same thing, only not switch 
tables.

Why?  The personalities should just pass the BARRIER flag down to each 
underlying device, and the dm common code should wait for all in flight 
io to complete before sending the barrier to the personality.

Don't you have to flush the cache BEFORE the barrier to ensure that 
previous IO is committed first, THEN the barrier write?
