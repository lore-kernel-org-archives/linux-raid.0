Yes, indeed. All async_tx APIs have lot of checks and for high throughput
RAID offload engine these checks can add some overhead.

I think doing checks in Linux md would be certainly better but this would
mean lot of changes in Linux md as well as remove checks in async_tx.

Also, async_tx APIs should not find DMA channel on its own instead it
should rely on Linux md to provide DMA channel pointer as parameter.

It's better to do checks cleanup in async_tx as separate patchset and
keep this patchset simple.
