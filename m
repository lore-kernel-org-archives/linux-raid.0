"RFC-by" must be some overly clever thing I thought up or saw at one =
point.  i can certainly break that habit.  I had seen that possibly =
setting 'mddev->safemode =3D 2' might be a possible solution.  I was =
also a bit confused if I should pull the 'del_timer_sync' from =
'md_stop_writes'.  This is why I put the RFC in there, but I see your =
meaning.

Thanks,
