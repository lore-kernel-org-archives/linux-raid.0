I'm not Alex, but yeah, we have all the clone/split machinery and so we
can handle a spanning case just fine.  I think rbd_merge_bvec() exists
to make sure we don't have to do that unless it's really necessary -
like when a single page gets submitted at an inconvenient offset.

I have a patch that adds a blk_queue_chunk_sectors(object_size) call to
rbd_init_disk() but I haven't had a chance to play with it yet.  In any
case, we should be fine with getting rid of rbd_merge_bvec().  If this
ends up a per-driver patchset, I can make rbd_merge_bvec() ->
blk_queue_chunk_sectors() a single patch and push it through
ceph-client.git.

Thanks,
