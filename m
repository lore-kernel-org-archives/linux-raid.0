It wasn't my math, it was my reading :-(
16-lane PCIe 4.0 is 31 GB/sec so 2GB/sec per drive.  I was reading the
"1-lane" number...

Indeed.  It seems likely that with modern hardware, the  linear write speed
would be the limiting factor for spinning-rust drives.
For SSDs the limit might end up being somewhere else ...
