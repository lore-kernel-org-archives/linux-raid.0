Hrm... I may have misunderstood the perspective you were talking from. 
Yes, when the bio is completed it must be on the media, but the 
filesystem should issue both requests, and then really not care when 
they complete.  That is to say, the filesystem should not wait for block 
A to finish before issuing block B; it should issue both, and use 
barriers to make sure they hit the disk in the correct order.

Right... it just needs to control the order of the requests, just not 
wait on one to finish before issuing the next.
