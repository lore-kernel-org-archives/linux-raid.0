Here's what I've done to reproduce this:

- remove a disk containing one leg of an LVM raid1 mirror
- do enough IO that a lengthy recovery will be required
- insert the removed disk
- let recovery begin, but deactivate the LV before it completes
- activate the LV

This is the point where the recovery should start back up, but it 
doesn't. I haven't tried this in a few weeks, but am happy to try it 
again if it would help.
