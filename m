In that case we are not able to distinguish if computer is going to be=20
hibernated or just suspended to RAM.

If we have both notifier (one for suspend and for hibernate) then=20
different actions can be configured for suspend and hibernate.

And it makes sense to configure different behaviour for suspend and for=20
hibernate. E.g. when you have encrypted partition where is stored=20
hibernation image then you do not have to wipe keys before going to do=20
hibernation. But for suspend to RAM you may want to wipe them.
