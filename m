Yes - the snapshot store can be extended while the snapshot is active.

The snapshot target could be hacked so that it remembers space trimmed 
with REQ_OP_DISCARD and won't reallocate these blocks.

But I suspect that running discard over the whole device would degrade 
performance more than copying some unneeded data.

How much data do you intend to backup with this solution?
