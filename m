  They can't have 2 near copies and 2 far copies, for example.  Perhaps som=
eone might choose this layout for read balancing performance...

I came across a bit of code in raid10 recently which would not work properly
in at least some combinations of  near>1 and far>1.  It might have been only
when 'raid_disks' was not divisible by 'near' - I'd have to check.

Obviously I don't *know* that no-one ever uses a layout like this, but I've
never heard of one.  Only rarely do people have 3 copies.  Having 4 seems
excessive.
So while I cannot safely change mdadm to reject the combination I have no
concern about never allowing the combination with dm-raid.  (are there enou=
gh
double-negatives there?).

I think we should keep it simple.  Copies + layout.  Anything more complex
doesn't - in my opinion - bring any real value at all.
