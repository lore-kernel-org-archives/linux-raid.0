You can find the fscrypt patch at https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9795327/

Note that it's encrypting 4096-byte blocks, not 512-byte.  Also, it's using
AES-256 for the ESSIV tfm (since it uses a SHA-256 hash) but AES-128 for the
"real" encryption.  It's possible this is a mistake and it should be AES-128 for
both.  (If it is, it needs to be fixed before it's released in 4.13.)
