I would like to avoid growing bvec tables and keep everything
preallocated. Plus, a bvec_iter operates on a bvec which means
we'll need a table there as well... Not liking it so far...

This is exactly an example of not ignoring the bios...

I'm not sure how this helps me either. Unless we can set a bvec_iter to
span bvecs or have an abstract bio crossing when we re-initialize the
bvec_iter I don't see how I can ignore bios completely...

multipage-bvecs and nvme-tcp are going to conflict, so it would be good
to coordinate on this. I think that nvme-tcp host needs some adjustments
as setting a bvec_iter. I'm under the impression that the change is 
rather small and self-contained, but I'm not sure I have the full
picture here.
