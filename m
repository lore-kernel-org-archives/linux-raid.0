Thanks Neil!

I mentioned to Neil last year that I could probably be convinced,
bribed, shamed, into maintaining mdadm.

The kernel MD stack I think really needs a team to run it. There is jus=
t
too much internal knowledge sitting in Neil's head and I personally am =
a
little scared of taking on that. Shaohua Li would be a good candidate
for that team IMHO.

Cheers,
Jes
