Hi Song, could be some problem with sync command; using either 
'oflag=direct' or 'oflag=sync' fails the dd command instantly when a 
member is removed.

Exactly! This is the main concern here, mdadm cannot stop the array 
since it's mounted, and there's no filesystem API to quickly shutdown 
the filesystem, hence it keeps "alive" for too long after the failure.

For instance, if we have a raid0 with 2 members and remove the 1st, it 
fails much quicker than if we remove the 2nd; the filesystem will 
"realize" the device is flaw quickly if we remove the 1st member, and 
goes to RO mode. Specially, xfs seems even faster than ext4 in noticing 
the failure.

Do you have any suggestion on how could we reduce this latency? And how 
about the status exhibited by mdadm, shall it move from 'clean' to 
something more meaningful in the failure case?

Thanks again,


Guilherme
