So you've mentioned several times that hardware needs big blocks. How big
those blocks need to be? Ideally, can you give some numbers on how the
throughput of the encryption hw grows with the block size?

Because as Mike had said there are downsides to having request based
dm-crypt as well. E.g. if you want to have encrypted raid5 volume then
you'd rather want to put encryption on top of raid5 (easier management,
larger sequential blocks to encrypt, ...) but you cannot do that when
dm-crypt would be request based. So modifying bio-based dm-crypt to form
larger chunks for encryption HW would be superior in this regard.

You mentioned that you use requests because of size limitations on bios - I
had a look and current struct bio can easily describe 1MB requests (that's
assuming 64-bit architecture, 4KB pages) when we have 1 page worth of
struct bio_vec. Is that not enough?
