I know that. This is why it says "The target does not try to determine
if the underlying drive reliably support data overwrites, this decision
is solely on the discretion of a user. Please note that not all drivers

Probably, a concerned user should test his setup to be sure discards
reach dm-secdel (after that they go as writes), and data he thinks
should be erased is erased.
