It might be good to replace patch 1 and this one by a patch per driver
to remove the merge_bvec_fn instance and add the blk_queue_split call
for all those drivers that actually had a ->merge_bvec_fn.  As some
of them were non-trivial attention from the maintainers would be helpful,
and a patch per driver might help with that.

This just checks the lower device, so it looks obviously fine.

As mentioned in the comment pkt_make_request will split the bio so pkt
looks fine.

It seems rbd handles requests spanning objects just fine, so I don't
really understand why rbd_merge_bvec even exists.  Getting some form
of ACK from the ceph folks would be useful.

DM seems to have the most complex merge functions of all drivers, so
I'd really love to see an ACK from Mike.
