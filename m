Thanks, I'll do that.

I was about to write the same in reply to Josefs mail :-)

First off, I'll go for the tracking part then.

I'll see whether implementing the retry mechanism somewhere near
end_bio_multi_stripe is a good thing or else, how to fiddle the
mirror_num further up so the code calling the hooks can care for the
retries and repairs.
