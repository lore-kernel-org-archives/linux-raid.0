Could you explain your logic here?  Why do you think rebuilding parity
will take 3 times as long as rebuilding a copy?  Can you measure that sort =
of
difference today?

Presumably when we have 20TB drives we will also have more cores and quite
possibly dedicated co-processors which will make the CPU load less
significant.
