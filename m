I could do some git archeology to see what the fs, mm and block core
changes were to stop using bdi congested but a pointer to associated
changes (or quick recap) would save me some time.

Also, curious to know how back-pressure should be felt back up the IO
stack now? (apologies if these are well worn topics, I haven't been
tracking this area of development).

Thanks,
Mike
