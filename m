It's not from Greg or Kay. It just appeared some day in the context of =
dm. :)

And yes, symlinks *look* nice and simple for the outside, but they are
not, and have all sorts of problems like non-atomic updates, make it
impossible to ever rename a device (as long as they copy the device
name), and and and .... we should not add more of this.

Btrfs does not use any blockdev as the master for good reason, and it
can never map its slaves inside of /sys/block. Simple meta-blockdevs
like md/dm just don't fit into modern requirements of a filesystem
(directory snapshots, directory subvolumes, complex raids, hassle-free
resizing, ...)  -- hence btrfs is much more like a network-filesystem
mount than a stream of blocks like a disk, and does not fit at all
into this model.
