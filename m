I think the only real need for the reap_sync_thread() call is to make the
change synchronous.  i.e. after "echo frozen > sync_action" completes, you
know that the array actually is frozen, rather that it should be frozen very
soon.  This can be important for code which wants to set 'frozen', then
manipulate the array in a way that would be prevented if it was still
undergoing a resync/recovery/check/etc.

I'm don't know how much I actually depend on that property, but it sounds
like a good one to have.
I would probably be OK to export reap_sync_thread() so that dm-raid can use
it.

I see your point.  I don't have any opinion on whether it is a real problem
or just a theoretical one though.

In general, the patch looks good - particular as it includes documentation
changes!  When you get a very you are happy with I'll apply it.

Thanks,
