Yes, because it is not general.   That makes it hard to explain or describe.
That in turn makes mistake easier.

That doesn't mean that I am dead-set against it, but I'm not sure I want to
encourage it.
I don't think RAID10 array with 'odd' numbers of drives are that common in
the first place.
You suggestion would make no difference for 3 devices, a small difference f=
or
5 (4 vulnerable pairs instead of 5) and only becomes significant with 7 or
more devices.  Are people going to make arrays with 7 devices (with 5
vulnerable pairs) instead of 8 devices (with 4 vulnerable pairs)?

In my copious spare time.

Let's see if Jon comes up with something.
