My complaint was mainly that the proposed dmcrypt based version just did
not work properly.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/1/2/109

(I did not test the new version we are replying here. I wonder how the problem
I mentioned is fixed though.
Also see Mikulas' comments https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-January/msg00145.html)
 
Anyway, all this seems to optimize case for specific crypto hw, that
is not able to perform optimally with pattern dmcrypt produces.

I do not think dmcrypt should do optimizations for specific hw.

But if we decide that it is needed there, it should not cause any performance
or compatibility problems elsewhere...
