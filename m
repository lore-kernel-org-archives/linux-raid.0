I'm actually a bit confused about this too.
I thought David said he was removing a branch on the *slow* path - which make
sense as you wouldn't even test NOFAIL until you had a failure.
Why are branches on the slow-path an issue??
This is an important question to me because I still hope to see the
swap-over-nfs patches merged eventually and they add a branch on the slow
path (if I remember correctly).
