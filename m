So this Intel Matrix/Firmware RAID can be used to boot Linux with
/dev/mapper/target - DM-raid. DM-raid is missing some functionality,
most notable raid5 I guess, that was the main reason behind injecting
MD-raid code into DM?

What is clearly a good thing (multiple OS support, easier setup from
firmware and more raid levels to boot from) makes me wonder about MD
future. I'm sure this will attract users to use DM-raid in favor of
MD-raid, if its good or bad, time will tell.

Neil, don't take this in some BAD way please, I'm just not convinced of
dm-every{thing,where} movement. At least not yet..

TIA, Z.
