This is all true.  And md code is getting better at using more cores
under more circumstances, making the parity calculations more efficient.

The speed concern (which was Stan's, rather than mine) is more about
recovery and rebuild.  If you have a layered raid with raid1 pairs at
the bottom level, then recovery and rebuild (from a single failure) is
just a straight copy from one disk to another - you don't get faster
than that.  If you have a 20 + 3 parity raid, then rebuilding requires
reading a stripe from 20 disks and writing to 1 disk - that's far more
effort and is likely to take more time unless your IO system can handle
full bandwidth of all the disks simultaneously.

Similarly, performance of the array while rebuilding or degraded is much
worse for parity raids than for raids on top of raid1 pairs.

How that matters to you, and how it balances with the space costs, is up
to you and your application.
