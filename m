Wait. Do filesystems expect (depend on) anything but ordering now? Does 
md? Having users of barriers as they currently behave suddenly getting 
SYNC behavior where they expect ORDERED is likely to have a negative 
effect on performance. Or do I misread what is actually guaranteed by 
WRITE_BARRIER now, and a flush is currently happening in all cases?

And will this also be available to user space f/s, since I just proposed 
a project which uses one? :-(
I think the goal is good, more choice is almost always better choice, I 
just want to be sure there won't be big disk performance regressions.
