Or perhaps if the request_fn blocks, that would be problematic. So the
patch is likely a good idea even for that case.

I'll merge it, changing it to list_splice_init() as I think that would
be more clear.

Maybe I'm missing something, but why do you need those callbacks? If
it's to use plugging yourself, perhaps we can just ensure that those
don't get assigned in the task - so it would be have to used with care.

It's not that I disagree to these callbacks, I just want to ensure I
understand why you need them.
