From the code, WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE is only used to set
WORKER_CPU_INTENSIVE, and WORKER_CPU_INTENSIVE is only used
as part of WORKER_NOT_RUNNING, which includes WORKER_UNBOUND.
So, I agree that with current code, WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE with WQ_UNBOUND
is same as WQ_UNBOUND alone.

However, I don't think it is necessary to make the changes. They don't really
improve readability of the code.

Thanks,
Song
