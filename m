Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/2] more raid456 thread pool experimentation

The current implementation with the async thread pool ends up spreading
the work over too many threads.  The btrfs workqueue is targeted at high
cpu utilization works and has a threshold mechanism to limit thread
spawning.  Unfortunately it still ends up increasing cpu utilization
without a comparable improvement in throughput.  Here are the numbers
relative to the multicore disabled case:

idle_thresh	throughput	cycles
4		+0%		+102%
64		+4%		+63%
128		+1%		+45%

This appears to show that something more fundamental needs to happen to
take advantage of percpu raid processing.  More profiling is needed, but
the suspects in my mind are conf->device_lock contention and the fact
that all work is serialized through conf->handle_list with no method for
encouraging stripe_head to thread affinity.

The idle_thresh parameter translates to the number of stripes that can
be in a thread's backlog before new work spills over into a new thread.
The current implementation via async is effectively using a threshold of
zero which ends up impacting throughput due to excessive cpu utilization
and thread creation.  I do not think we need any more experimentation
before declaring the current implementation broken.
