Hi all,

A while back I worked through the maths for a method of extending raid
to multiple parities, though I never got as far as implementing it in
code (other than some simple Python test code to confirm the maths).  It
is also missing the maths for simplified ways to recover data.  I've
posted a couple of times with this on the linux-raid mailing list (as
linked in this thread) - there has certainly been some interest, but
it's not easy to turn interest into hard work!

I used an obvious expansion on the existing RAID5 and RAID6 algorithms,
with parity P_n being generated from powers of 2^n.  This means that the
triple-parity version can be implemented by simply applying the RAID6
operations twice.  For a triple parity, this works well - the matrices
involved are all invertible up to 255 data disks.  Beyond that, however,
things drop off rapidly - quad parity implemented in the same way only
supports 21 data disks, and for five parity disks you need to use 0x20
(skipping 0x10) to get even 8 data disks.

This means that my method would be fine for triple parity, and would
also be efficient in implementation.

Beyond triple parity, the simple method has size limits for four parity
and is no use on anything bigger.  The Cauchy matrix method lets us go
beyond that (I haven't yet studied your code and your maths - I will do
so as soon as I have the chance, but I doubt if that will be before the
weekend).

Would it be possible to use the simple parity system for the first three
parities, and Cauchy beyond that?  That would give the best of both worlds.



The important thing to think about here is what would actually be useful
in the real world.  It is always nice to have a system that can make an
array with 251 data disks and 6 parities (and I certainly think the
maths involved is fun), but would anyone use such a beast?

Triple parity has clear use cases.  As people have moved up from raid5
to raid6, "raid7" or "raid6-3p" would be an obvious next step.  I also
see it as being useful for maintenance on raid6 arrays - if you want to
replace disks on a raid6 array you could first add a third parity disk
with an asymmetric layout, then you could replace the main disks while
keeping two disk redundancy at all times.

Quad parity is unlikely, I think - you would need a very wide array and
unusual requirements to make quad parity a better choice than a layered
system of raid10 or raid15.  At most, I think it would find use as a
temporary security while maintaining a triple-raid array.  Remember also
that such an array would be painfully slow if it ever needed to rebuild
data with four missing disks - and if it is then too slow to be usable,
then quad parity is not a useful solution.


(Obviously anyone with /real/ experience with large arrays can give
better ideas here - I like the maths of multi-parity raid, but I will
not it for my small arrays.)



Of course I will enjoy studying your maths here, and I'll try to give
some feedback on it.  But I think for implementation purposes, the
simple "powers of 4" generation of triple parity would be better than
using the Cauchy matrix - it is a clear step from the existing raid6,
and it can work fast on a wide variety of processors (people use ARMs
and other "small" cpus on raids, not just x86 with SSE3).  I believe
that would mean simpler code and fewer changes, which is always popular
with the kernel folk.

However, if it is not possible to use Cauchy matrices to get four and
more parity while keeping the same first three parities, then the
balance changes and a decision needs to be made - do we (the Linux
kernel developers, the btrfs developers, and the users) want a simpler
system that is limited to triple parity (or quad parity with 21 + 4
disks), or do we want a more complex but more flexible system?

Personally, I don't mind either way, as long as we get a good technical
solution.  And I'll do what I can to help with the maths in either case.

David
