The whole article goes to 2019 (or longer). He shows current trends
and discusses where they are going in the future. The whole point of
the article is looking ahead into the future.

No, that is not what the article finds. In the near future (about 10
years), triple-parity will suffice. Beyond that, perhaps quad-parity
will be required, but predicting that far ahead is usually worthless
in the computer industry.

I'll take triple- or 4-parity every time over the disk-wasting and
less reliable RAID 15. There is no need for 5-parity in the near
future.  I see no advantage of RAID 15, and several disadvantages.
