Just for the records: You don't need bitmaps for that, this happens on
plain non-bitmapped devices as well.
I had an interesting discussion about this with Heinz Mauelshagen on the
linux-raid list back in early 2006 starting with
	Message-ID: <du6t39$be5$1@sea.gmane.org>

And it's not that unlikely at all. I experience such inconsistencies
regularly on ext2/3 filesystems with heavy inode fluctuations (for
example via cp -al; rsync, like rsnapshot does). I periodically sync
these inconsistencies manual. However, it always seems to appear with
inode removal only, which is rather harmless.
