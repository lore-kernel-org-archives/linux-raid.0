Thanks.

Yes, but my recent dm-raid45 patch on dm-devel allows for selection of
the xor routine being used and its parameters..

Fiddling the macros into xor_block_template structs would allow for
testing them with other callers...

Those xor data from multiple blocks via sequenced single xor operations
whereas mine does them in one go.

I don't think so but that's one question to answer.
