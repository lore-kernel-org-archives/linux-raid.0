But this remainder is not the top remainder any more, I guess you mean
the following situation:

- drbd_make_request(bio)
       ->generic_make_request(bio)
              ->bio is added into current->bio_list
- bio is splitted as bio_a and bio_b in generic_make_request()
- dm_make_request(bio_a)
        ->generic_make_request(bio_a)
               ->bio_a is add into current_list
- bio_a is splitted as bio_a_a and bio_a_b in generic_make_request()
- dm_make_request(bio_a_a)
      ->.....
- bio_a_b is added into current->bio_list
- dm_make_request(bio_a_b)

But it is correct because bio_a depends on both bio_a_a and bio_a_b.
Or I understand you wrong?

For the reported bio splitting issue, I think the goal is to make sure all
BIOs generated from 'bio' inside .make_request_fn(bio) are queued
before the 'current' remainder. Cause it is the issue introduced by
blk_split_bio().
