> The missed module alias was an oversight, thanks for catching that.  (Sim=
ilar - as you can see from this patch - to the oversight I had when introdu=
cing raid1. :)  I have gone back and forth on whether to include the altern=
ate "raid1e" or not.  There are different RAID1E algorithms, as described i=
n the kernel doc.  Perhaps there should also be aliases similar to raid5 an=
d raid6 - like raid1e_as (i.e. RAID1E - Adjacent Stripe), etc.  However, th=
ere are several combinations that don't have a real name.  Any thoughts?  I=
 would be just fine leaving "raid1e" out as I would leaving it in.  These d=
ays, RAID10 is really a subset of RAID1E - perhaps I should be considering =
taking "raid10" out.  ;)

I don't really have much of an opinion here - as long as the scheme chosen =
is
coherent and extensible I'm happy.

I probably wouldn't have chosen to attach the layout to the "raid5" (e.g.
raid5_la), but I don't object.  The info has to go somewhere and it will
always be a smallish set of choices.
I probably would suggest not supporting both "raid10" and "raid1e" as that
could lead to confusion.  I can see good reasons for choosing either though.

> I like your suggestion of changing the parameter names.  I've found the o=
riginal names somewhat confusing.  ('far_offset' seems to imply to me that =
the copy would not be the very next stripe, but _offset_ somehow - it seems=
 to have the reverse meaning to me.  I think this comes from the fact that =
it acts as a modifier to 'far_copy'.)  I toyed with a couple different ways=
 of doing this but figured it was best to just go along.  Anyway, what you =
are suggesting seems to be:

 That seems nice to me and seems to clear up some of the confusion caused b=
y "far_offset" seeming to be a modifier to "far_copies".

Yes, that is what I'm suggesting.

There is probably some tool that does that.  It might help a little bit so =
if
you find it easy, then do it.  But if it is at all a burden, don't bother.
