Both, throughput falls off a cliff with the async thread pool, and
there are more knobs to turn in this implementation.

Thanks I'll take a look at these suggestions.  For these optimizations
to have a chance I think we need stripes to maintain affinity with the
first core that picks up the work.  Currently all stripes take a trip
through the single-threaded raid5d when their reference count drops to
zero, only to be immediately reissued to the thread pool potentially
on a different core (but I need to back this assumption up with more
profiling).

btr_queue seemed to make sense since it's spreading work like "butter" =
:-).
