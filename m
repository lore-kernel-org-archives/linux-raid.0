Currently only dm and md/raid5 bios trigger
trace_block_bio_complete().  Now that we have bio_chain() and
bio_inc_remaining(), it is not possible, in general, for a driver to
know when the bio is really complete.  Only bio_endio() knows that.

So move the trace_block_bio_complete() call to bio_endio().

Now trace_block_bio_complete() pairs with trace_block_bio_queue().
Any bio for which a 'queue' event is traced, will subsequently
generate a 'complete' event.

There are a few cases where completion tracing is not wanted.
1/ If blk_update_request() has already generated a completion
   trace event at the 'request' level, there is no point generating
   one at the bio level too.  In this case the bi_sector and bi_size
   will have changed, so the bio level event would be wrong

2/ If the bio hasn't actually been queued yet, but is being aborted
   early, then a trace event could be confusing.  Some filesystems
   call bio_endio() but do not want tracing.

3/ The bio_integrity code interposes itself by replacing bi_end_io,
   then restoring it and calling bio_endio() again.  This would produce
   two identical trace events if left like that.

To handle these, we introduce a flag BIO_TRACE_COMPLETION and only
produce the trace event when this is set.
We address point 1 above by clearing the flag in blk_update_request().
We address point 2 above by only setting the flag when
generic_make_request() is called.
We address point 3 above by clearing the flag after generating a
completion event.

When bio_split() is used on a bio, particularly in blk_queue_split(),
there is an extra complication.  A new bio is split off the front, and
may be handle directly without going through generic_make_request().
The old bio, which has been advanced, is passed to
generic_make_request(), so it will trigger a trace event a second
time.
Probably the best result when a split happens is to see a single
'queue' event for the whole bio, then multiple 'complete' events - one
for each component.  To achieve this was can:
- copy the BIO_TRACE_COMPLETION flag to the new bio in bio_split()
- avoid generating a 'queue' event if BIO_TRACE_COMPLETION is already set.
This way, the split-off bio won't create a queue event, the original
won't either even if it re-submitted to generic_make_request(),
but both will produce completion events, each for their own range.

So if generic_make_request() is called (which generates a QUEUED
event), then bi_endio() will create a single COMPLETE event for each
range that the bio is split into, unless the driver has explicitly
requested it not to.
