Just last year, looks not long enough, :-)

As I explained before, neither .bi_vcnt will be changed after submitting,
nor be changed during merging, so I think the checking is wrong,
could you explain what is your initial motivation of checking on
'bio->bi_vcnt == 1'?

Could you explain what is problematic for the cleanliness?
