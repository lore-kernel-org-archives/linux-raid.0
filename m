Currently if a md/raid0 array gets one or more members removed while
being mounted, kernel keeps showing state 'clean' in the 'array_state'
sysfs attribute. Despite udev signaling the member device is gone, 'mdadm'
cannot issue the STOP_ARRAY ioctl successfully, given the array is mounted.

Nothing else hints that something is wrong (except that the removed devices
don't show properly in the output of 'mdadm detail' command). There is no
other property to be checked, and if user is not performing reads/writes
to the array, even kernel log is quiet and doesn't give a clue about the
missing member.

This patch changes this behavior; when 'array_state' is read we introduce
a non-expensive check (only for raid0) that relies in the comparison of
the total number of disks when array was assembled with gendisk flags of
those devices to validate if all members are available and functional.
A new array state 'broken' was added: it mimics the state 'clean' in every
aspect, being useful only to distinguish if such array has some member
missing. Also, we show a rate-limited warning in kernel log in such case.

This patch has no proper functional change other than adding a 'clean'-like
state; it was tested with ext4 and xfs filesystems. It requires a 'mdadm'
counterpart to handle the 'broken' state.
