I'm leaning towards the files-in-/run/mdadm approach too.  I'll make a
proper patch.

When would we clear the "not initialised yet" flag in the kernel, and
how?  And would that be enough.

When mdadm creates an md array, at least 3 uevents get generated.
The first is generated when the md device object is created, either by
opening the /dev/mdXX file, or by writing magic to somewhere in sysfs.
The second is generated when the array is started and the content is
visible.
The third is generated when mdadm closes the file descriptor.  It opens
/dev/mdXX for O_RDWR and performs ioctls on this, and then closes it.
Because udev uses inotify to watch for a 'close for a writable file
descriptor', this generates another event.

We need to ensure that none of these cause udev to run anything that
inspects the contents of the array.
Of the three, only the second one is directly under the control of the
md module, so only that one can add an environment variable.

It might be possible to avoid the last one (by not opening for write),
but I cannot see a way to avoid the first one.

I don't think that making a file appear in /run is really very different
from making a variable appear in a uevent.   If the variable were
describing the event itself there would be a different, but it would be
describing the state of the device.  So the only important difference is
"which is easier to work with".  I think creating an deleting a file is
easier to setting and clearing a variable.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
