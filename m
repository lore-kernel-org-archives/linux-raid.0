I don't, I was agreeing with what you're saying :)

I originally pushed these to the callers, but Andrew thought it would be 
better so that we could audit the existing users that have no fallback 
behavior, even though they could go implement it on their own (like 
getblk() which actually does try _some_ memory freeing).  It eliminates 
the flag from the page allocator and saves branches in the slowpath.  We 
don't need this logic in the allocator itself, it can exist at a higher 
level and, with deprecation, will hopefully be incentive enough for those 
subsystems to fix the issue.

I'll repropose the patchset with __deprecated as you suggested.  Thanks!
