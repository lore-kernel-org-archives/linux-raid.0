Well, one question is "can handle" and other question is how big gain in
throughput it will bring compared to say 1M chunks. I suppose there's some
constant overhead to issue a request to the crypto hw and by the time it is
encrypting 1M it may be that this overhead is well amortized by the cost of
the encryption itself which is in principle linear in the size of the
block. That's why I'd like to get idea of the real numbers...

As Christoph mentions 4.3 should be better in submitting larger bios. Did
you check it?
