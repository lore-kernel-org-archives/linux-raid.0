Thanks a lot for working on this!

I think we should be able to do without adding another API for this.
Can we instead put the information into the key and/or the IV?

Also it would really help if you could attach a patch for dm-crypt
that goes along with this (it doesn't have to be complete or
functional, just showing how this is meant to be used)

Thanks,
