When I found a bug in dm-crypt, I searched the other targets for the same 
problem and found out that the same bug is also present in dm-log-writes.

The bug in dm-log-writes can be reproduced if you make a bcache device 
with 2MiB bucket size and place in on the dm-log-writes target.

When the bug is present, the dm-log-writes target reports "device-mapper: 
log-writes: Couldn't alloc log bio".

This is a script that triggers the bug for dm-log-writes. Before running 
the script, create devices /dev/mapper/loop-test1, loop-test2 and 
loop-test3.
