if i would have been aware that RAID10 don't support "--write-mostly" to
make a hybrid HDD/SSD RAID (https://www.tansi.org/hybrid/) i would
likely have done exactly that to buy only 2 instead 4 x 2 TB SSD disks
here and frankly i have another 5 machines where this limitation of
RAID110 on linux sucks
