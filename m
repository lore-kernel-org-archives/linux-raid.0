Sure, will use "static inline functions" instead these macros.

If there was a work completed when mbox_client_peek_data()
is called then sba_receive_message() will be called immediately
by mailbox controller driver.

We are doing dma_cookie_complete() in sba_receive_message()
so if mbox_client_peek_data() is called before dma_cookie_status()
then dma_cookie_status() will see correct state of cookie.

Also, I explored virt-dma APIs for BCM-SBA-RAID driver. The virt-dma
implements tasklet based bottom-half for each virt-dma-channel. This
bottom-half is not required for BCM-FS4-RAID driver because its a
mailbox client driver and the mailbox controller driver already implements
bottom-half for each mailbox channel.

If we still go ahead and use virt-dma in BCM-FS4-RAID driver then we
will have two bottom-halfs in-action one in mailbox controller driver and
another in BCM-FS4-RAID driver which in-turn will add bottom-half
scheduling overhead thereby reducing performance of BCM-FS4-RAID
driver.
