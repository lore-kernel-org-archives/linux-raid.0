"This" doesn't appear to be what SOME people, who have reported
issues, are experiencing. Their issues must be examined on a case by
case basis.

But I, and a number of other people I have talked to or corresponded
with, have had mdadm RAID 5 or RAID 6 rebuilds of one drive run at
approximately the optimal sequential write speed of the replacement
drive. It is not unusual on a reasonably configured system.

I don't know how fast the rebuilds go on the experimental RAID 5 or
RAID 6 for btrfs.
