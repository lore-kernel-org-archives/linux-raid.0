Interesting, do the btrfs workqueues improve things?  Or do you think they are
just a better base for more tuning?

I had always hoped to find more users for the work queues and tried to
keep btrfs specific features out of them.  The place I didn't entirely
succeed was in the spin locks, the ordered queues take regular spin
locks to avoid turning off irqs where btrfs always does things outside
of interrupt time.  Doesn't look like raid needs the ordered queues so
this should work pretty well.

The big place I'd suggest to look inside the btrfs async-thread.c for
optimization is the worker_loop().  For work that tends to be bursty and
relatively short, we can have worker threads finish their work fairly
quickly and go to sleep, only to be woken up very quickly again with
another big batch of work.  The worker_loop code tries to wait around
for a while, but the tuning here was btrfs specific.

It might also help to tune the find_worker and next_worker code to prefer
giving work to threads that are running but almost done with their
queue.  Maybe they can be put onto a special hot list as they get near
the end of their queue.

There's a rule somewhere that patches renaming things must have replies
questioning the new name.  The first reply isn't actually allowed to
suggest a better name, which is good because I'm not very good at
that kind of thing.

Really though, btr_queue is fine by me, but don't feel obligated to keep
some variation of btrfs in the name ;)
