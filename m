Ted,

That implies that the SSD folks are not treating erase blocks as a
contiguous group of sectors.  For some reason, I thought their was
only one mapping per erase block and within the erase block the
sectors were contiguous..

If I'm right, then the ata spec may allow you to send sub-erase block
trim commands down, but the spec does not prevent the (blackbox)
hardware from clipping the size of the trim to be on erase block
boundaries and ignoring the sub-erase block portions on each end.  Or
ignoring the whole command if your trim command does not span a whole
erase block.

Also the mdraid people plan to clip at the stripe width boundary for
raid 5, 6, etc.  Their expectation is that discards will be coalesced
into bigger blocks before it gets to the mdraid layer.

I still think reshaping a raid 5 online will be next to impossible
when some of the stripes may contain indeterminate data.

More realistic is to figure out a way to make it deterministic at
least for the short term (by writing data to all the trimmed blocks?),
then reshaping, then having a tool to scan the filesystem and re-issue
all the trim commands.

Obviously, if the ata spec had a signaling mechanism that
differentiated between deterministic data and non-deterministic data
then the above code excess could be simplified greatly.
