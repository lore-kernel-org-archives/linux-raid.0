You must see a week long rebuild as acceptable...

I disagree.

Mr. Leventhal did not address the overwhelming problem we face, which is
(multiple) parity array reconstruction time.  He assumes the time to
simply 'populate' one drive at its max throughput is the total
reconstruction time for the array.  While this is typically true for
mirror based arrays, it is clearly not for parity arrays.

The primary focus of my comments was reducing rebuild time, thus
increasing overall reliability.  RAID 51 or something similar would
achieve this.  Thus I think we should discuss alternatives to multiple
parity in detail.
