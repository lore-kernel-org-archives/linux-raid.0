This is part of defining a common interface.  Maybe look at the
linkages of how the common ioat_probe() routine is used to support all
three versions of its dma hardware.

You definitely need to be able to resolve "used but not defined" and
"defined but not used" warnings before tackling a driver conversion
like this.  In light of this comment I wonder if it would be
appropriate to submit your original driver, that just duplicated
routines from the ppc440spe driver, to the -staging tree.  Then it
would be available for someone familiar with driver conversions to
take a shot at unifying.

Greg, is this an appropriate use of -staging?
