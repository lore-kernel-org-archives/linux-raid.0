"Selection bias" would infer I'm doing some kind of formal analysis,
which is obviously not the case, though I do understand the point you're
making.

When folks report problems on linux-raid it is commonplace for others to
reply that the same feature works fine for them, that the problem may be
configuration specific, etc.  When people have reported slow RAID5/6
rebuilds in the past, and these were not always reported in direct help
requests but as "me too" posts, I don't recall others saying their
parity rebuilds are speedy.  I'm not saying nobody ever has, simply that
I don't recall such.  Which is why I've been under the impression that
parity rebuilds are generally slow for everyone.

I wish I had hardware available to perform relevant testing.  It would
be nice to have some real data on this showing apples to apples rebuild
times for the various RAID levels on the same hardware.
