It would not be a problem if it did take that long, since I would have
extra parity units as backup in case of a failure during a rebuild.

But of course it would not take that long. Take, for example, a 24 x
3TB triple-parity array (21+3) that has had two drive failures
(perhaps the rebuild started with one failure, but there was soon
another failure). I would expect the rebuild to take about a day.

Since Adam wrote the code for RAID-Z3 for ZFS, I'm sure he is aware of
the time to restore data to failed drives. I do not see any flaw in
his analysis related to the time needed to restore data to failed
drives.
