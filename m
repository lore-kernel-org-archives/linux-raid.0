I think setting MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED in mddev_resume makes perfect sense.
It is quite safe to set it at any time, and the one place where md.c calls
mddev_resume() it sets the flag immediately afterwards.  So moving that
setting into mddev_resume() makes sense.

MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN I'm less sure about.  If we clear it in mddev_resume(),
then as soon as you convert a RAID5 to a RAID6 it would start recovery of t=
he
extra device, even if you had set sync_action to 'frozen' first.  That would
be wrong.

I guess we are over-loading 'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN' it bit.  It means both
"user-space requested a freeze" and  "resync temporarily disabled".

I wonder if md_stop_writes() only needs to set it temporarily, and to make
sure MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED isn't set when it completes.  That might be enough??

However maybe it is easiest to just clear it in raid_resume() like you did.

I do :-)

md already does all the proper accounting for ->degraded, dm-raid shouldn't
need to.

Incrementing md.degraded in dev_parms shouldn't be needed as md_run is
subsequently called, and it sets md.degraded correctly.

incrementing it in read_disk_sb() and setting the Faulty flag is wrong.  I
think it should just call md_error().

The other changes in that patch look OK.

That sounds like it is behaving exactly as I would expect.
You have written to the filesystem (and so to the pagecache) but the
filesystem hasn't written to the device yet.  That happens after a time, or
on a 'sync' or 'fsync'.

You might be able to get the block device to ask the filesystem to flush
things out using freeze_bdev(), but I'm not sure of the details there.
It might not flush things, it might just ensure metadata is consistent - or
something.
