Well, it is for this time only a proposal. I do think it preserves all the benefits of raid10,far
especially the striping for reading, and I believe it brings redundancy beyond 1 drive up
from zero for odd-drive arrays to almost raid-1+0 - in my mind this is as good as it can get theoretically.
In my guts it feels like good design. I am exited about it:-)

Why do you feel it is clumsy? Because it is not as general as the current code, but it would take a few more lines to do it?
We do gain a lot of redundancy for say 20 more lines of code.

That is not the intention. The intention is for new implementers not
to implement the old scheme. That is, for new implementers to do it right.

I don't know. It may take a while to get it implemented as long as no seasoned 
kernel hackers are working on it. As it is implemented now by Barrow, why not then go
forward as planned. 

For the offset layout I don't have a good idea on how to improve the redundancy.
Maybe you or others have good ideas. Or is the offset layout an implementation
of a standard layout? Then there is not much ado. Except if we could find a layout that has
the same advantages but with better redundancy.

I would have hoped you would do it!

I am not a seasoned kernel hacker like you, but could you point me to the code where
the sequence of the blocks is done for far and offset? I would think it would only be a few places.

And then how to handle the two different layouts, and how to do a migration? Where would that be done?
