Ahh ... you are ASS U ME ing that it is a personal email address. Why?

And that person is going to get overwhelmed if the system is busy ...

I can't speak for anyone else, but if I were a maintainer I would more
consider myself an integrator. If patches are NOT sent to the list, then
there are two *likely* scenarios. Either

Good patches get dropped because there is no discussion, or

Bad patches get forwarded because there is no discussion.

(And on linux-raid, where I'm reading this, I think this is very much
the current state of affairs. Neil Brown has stepped down, and iirc the
person who has taken over actively wants the list to review things.)

You are assuming that "FullName" refers to a person. If I were a
maintainer I would personally be very upset with that state of affairs.
Why shouldn't "FullName" be the full name of a mailing list?

If I were a maintainer, it would be "not vetted by the mailing list? Not
going nowhere, nohow". Patches get sent to the mailing list, or they get
ignored.

Cheers,
Wol
