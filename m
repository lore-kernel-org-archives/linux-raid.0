You might not call them "plans" exactly, but I have had thoughts
about tracking which part of an raid5 had 'live' data and which were
trimmed.  I think that is the only way I could support TRIM, unless
devices guarantee that all trimmed blocks read a zeros, and that seems
unlikely.
You are right that the granularity would have to be at least
one stripe.
And a re-shape would be interesting, wouldn't it!  We could probably
avoid instantiating every trimmed block, but in general quite a few
would get instantiated.. I hadn't thought about that...
