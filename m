I don't think this is a primary concern for most filesystems even today.
Filesystems that work correctly > 16TB on 64-bit platforms should continue
to work correctly on 32-bit platforms.  ext4 and XFS will be fine, and
we can slap a "refuse to mount > 16TB filesystem on 32-bit" check in
*_fill_super() for the other filesystems, ext3 included.  Maintainers can
veto that if they think it will work, and for the rest I don't think
anyone will even notice.
