Hi Neil,

Was this concern about "punting to a separate thread" in reference to
the line of work from Mikulas at the top of this 'wip' branch?
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=wip

Have you looked at this closely?  Not seeing how you can say that given
that on schedule the bios on current->bio_list are flushed.

The incremental work to delay the offload of queued bios is just meant
to preserve existing bio submission order unless there is reason to
believe a deadlock exists.

I would agree that this timer based approach is rather "gross" to some
degree _but_ it beats deadlocks!  This code needs fixing.  And the fix
cannot be constrained to bio_queue_split() because DM isn't even using
it.

Mike
