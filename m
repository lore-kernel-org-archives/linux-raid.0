If that is the problem then the solution would be to just enable read-ahead.  
Don't we already have that in both the OS and the disk hardware?  The hard-
drive read-ahead buffer should at least cover the case where a seek completes 
but the desired sector isn't under the heads.

RAM size is steadily increasing, it seems that the smallest that you can get 
nowadays is 1G in a phone and for a server the smallest is probably 4G.

On the smallest system that might have an 8 disk array you should be able to 
use 512M for buffers which allows a read-ahead of 128 chunks.

Are you suggesting that it would be a common case that people just write data 
to an array and never read it or do an array scrub?  I hope that it will 
become standard practice to have a cron job scrubbing all filesystems.

Have you observed such 1 second reads in practice?

One thing I've considered doing is placing a cheap disk on a speaker cone to 
test vibration induced performance problems.  Then I can use a PC to control 
the level of vibration in a reasonably repeatable manner.  I'd like to see 
what the limits are for retries.

Some years ago a company I worked for had some vibration problems which 
dropped the contiguous read speed from about 100MB/s to about 40MB/s on some 
parts of the disk (other parts gave full performance).  That was a serious and 
unusual problem and it only abouty halved the overall speed.
