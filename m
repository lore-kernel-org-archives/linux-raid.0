That commit doesn't (or at least isn't supposed to) make any behavior
difference.  It's just repositioning flag bits.  If the commit is
actually causing the problem, I think one possibility is that whatever
code could be using hard coded constants which now are mapped to
different flags.  The mixed merge changes have been in mainline for
quite some time and shipping in all major distros too and this is the
first time this is reported, so I don't think it could be a widespread
problem.

Thanks.
