This work isn't going to fly as is.  I appreciate the effort and the
goal (without understanding _why_) but: you're open-coding, duplicating
and/or reinventing way too much in do_mounts_dm.c

1) You first need to answer: _why_ is using a proper initramfs not
viable?  A very simple initramfs that issues dmsetup commands, etc,
isn't so daunting is it?  Why is it so important for the kernel to
natively provide a dmsetup interface?  Chrome, Android, etc cannot use
initramfs?

2) If you are able to adequately justify the need for dm=:
I'd much rather the dm= kernel commandline be a simple series of
comma-delimited dmsetup-like commands.

You'd handle each command with extremely basic parsing:
 <dm_ioctl_cmd> <args> [, <dm_ioctl_cmd> <args>]
(inventing a special token to denote <newline>, to support tables with
multiple entries, rather than relying on commas and counts, etc)

and you'd then have do_mounts_dm.c open /dev/mapper/control directly and
issue proper DM ioctls rather than adding all your shim code.  This last
bit of opening /dev/mapper/control from init needs more research -- not
sure if doing such a thing from kernel is viable/safe/acceptable.
