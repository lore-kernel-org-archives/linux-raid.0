Hi,
 your attachment was very large and so the original mail didn't go out
to the list but went to the moderator instead, and I ended up with it
(thanks Alasdair!).

The syslog contained lots of things like:

May  4 00:57:02 ss4000 mdadm: RebuildStarted event detected on md device /dev/md0

suggesting that 'md1_resync' was blocked waiting for disk IO for 2 minutes
multiple times.

I have heard of another case of this happening when the md arrays were
built on top of dm logical volumes.

Could you please report exactly what kernel and distro you are using,
and describe your storage setup (what devices, what LVM, DM, MD, loop,
crypto, filesystem,.... is being used and how).
