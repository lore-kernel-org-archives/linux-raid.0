I guess with that many drives you could hit PCI bus throughput limits.

A 16-lane PCIe 4.0 could just about give 100MB/s to each of 16 devices.  So
you would really need top-end hardware to keep all of 16 drives busy in a
recovery.
So yes: rebuilding a drive in a 16-drive RAID6+ would be slower than in e.g.
a 20 drive RAID10.

I think we might have that multi-threading now - not sure exactly what is
enabled by default though.

I think it requires more than "need" - it requires "demand".  i.e. people
repeatedly expressing the need.  We certainly have had that for a while, but
not a very long while

Understood - and thanks for your observation.
