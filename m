I don't much care what value you use as long as it is of the same type as t=
he
variable you assign it to.  So maybe UINT_MAX, or maybe '2'.

I love consistency ... or at least I think I would if only I could find it
somewhere!

> I have seen what you do in calc_sectors(), I suppose I could bring that i=
n.  However, I'm simply trying to find the value that will be preliminarily=
 assigned to mddev->dev_sectors.  It is an enforced (perhaps unnecessary) c=
onstraint that the array length be divisible by the number of data devices.=
  I'm not accounting for chunk boundaries - I leave that to userspace to co=
nfigure and MD to catch.

In that case I suggest you keep it out of dmraid.

It might make sense to check that the resulting array size matches what
user-space said to expect - or is at-least-as-big-as.  However I don't see
much point in other size changes there.

Thanks,
