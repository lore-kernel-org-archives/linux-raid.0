It'd be useful to know whether this patch fixes your issue:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7398411/

Ming Lei didn't like it due to concerns about I contexts changing
(whereby breaking merging that occurs via plugging).

But if it _does_ fix your issue then the case for the change is
increased; and we just need to focus on addressing Ming's concerns
(Mikulas has some ideas).

Conversely, and in parallel, Mikulas can look to see if your approach
fixes the observed dm-snapshot deadlock that he set out to fix.
