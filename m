No because if you are correct about the very high CPU overhead during 
rebuild (which I don't see so dramatic as Andrea claims 500MB/sec for 
triple-parity, probably parallelizable on multiple cores), the speed of 
rebuild decreases proportionally and hence the stress and heating on the 
drives proportionally reduces, approximating that of normal operation.
And how often have you seen a drive failure in a week during normal 
operation?

But in reality, consider that a non-naive implementation of 
multiple-parity would probably use just the single parity during 
reconstruction if just one disk fails, using the multiple parities only 
to read the stripes which are unreadable at single parity. So the speed 
and time of reconstruction and performance penalty would be that of 
raid5 except in exceptional situations of multiple failures.

I don't like your approach of raid 51: it has the write overhead of 
raid5, with the waste of space of raid1.
So it cannot be used as neither a performance array nor a capacity array.
In the scope of this discussion (we are talking about very large 
arrays), the waste of space of your solution, higher than 50%, will make 
your solution costing double the price.

A competitor for the multiple-parity scheme might be raid65 or 66, but 
this is a so much dirtier approach than multiple parity if you think at 
the kind of rmw and overhead that will occur during normal operation.
