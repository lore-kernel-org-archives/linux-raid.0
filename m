This got originated from several crashes I have seen with 4.3 kernel.
The crashes
were caused by null dereferencing of io_barrier->per_cpu_ref.

The issue may no longer be relevant after commit c91852ff0815
("dm: optimize dm_request_fn()") because conditions for accessing
io_barrier may not longer exist. But fix should be considered for
forked stable trees.
