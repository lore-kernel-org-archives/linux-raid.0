I believe there is a mapping per LBA, not per erase block.  Of course,
different technologies will have different limitations here, but it
would be foolish to assume anything about SSDs at this point.

(For those who haven't heard my disclaimer before, the Intel SSD team
don't tell me anything fun about how the drives work internally).
