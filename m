Hi Song, thanks for your quick response, and sorry for my delay.
I've noticed after v4.18 kernel started to crash when we remove one
raid0 member while writing, so I was investigating this
before perform your test (in fact, found 2 issues [0]), hence my delay.

Your test does make sense; in fact I've tested your scenario with the
following code (with the patches from [0]):
https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/cyqpDqpM7x/

Indeed, fsync returns -1 in this case.
Interestingly, when I do a "dd if=<some_file> of=<raid0_mount>" and try
to "sync -f <some_file>" and "sync", it succeeds and the file is
written, although corrupted.

Do you think this behavior is correct? In other devices, like a pure
SCSI disk or NVMe, the 'dd' write fails.
Also, what about the status of the raid0 array in mdadm - it shows as
"clean" even after the member is removed, should we change that?

No changes other than rebase. Worth mentioning here that a kernel bot
(and Julia Lawall) found an issue in my patch; I forgot a
"mutex_lock(&mddev->open_mutex);" in line 6053, which caused the first
caveat (hung mdadm and persistent device in /dev). Thanks for pointing
this silly mistake from me! in case this patch gets some traction, I'll
re-submit with that fixed.

Cheers,


Guilherme
