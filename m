The api is such that you will not be able to tell ahead of time if the
operation is to be offloaded or carried out synchronously (unless of
course you disable offload by CONFIG_ASYNC_TX_DMA=3Dn).  The current
channel allocator hands out channels on a percpu basis so the
scheduling of the helper threads can be used as a proxy for scheduling
the offload engines.  I have considered allowing overloaded channels
to spill work back on to the cpu[1], but I need more data on whether
this is worthwhile.
