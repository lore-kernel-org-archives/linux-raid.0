Every laptop I've owned in the past five years has been set up as follo=
ws:

- GPT partition table (mostly for the redundant table at the end in cas=
e of=20
fuckups)
- 1GB ESP as /boot (first with grub2, then gummiboot) - It's there _any=
way_
- 32MB BIOS Boot Partition (for a traditional BIOS bootloader, so I can=
 pop
  the drive in a non-efi machine if the laptop dies - this has happened=
)
- The rest of the drive is a single dm-crypt volume, with LVM on top. W=
hat
  goes on top of LVM has varied, but these days it's just swap and btrf=
s.

The main reason for this is that I find dealing with crypttab / multipl=
e
LUKS devices on boot (or resume from hibernate) to be an incredible has=
sle;
and it's vastly simpler to  just have a single dm-crypt device and let
Dracut unlock it from a single boot prompt.

I haven't set up custom-key secure boot yet, so the evil maid attack is
still on the table, but I do this more out of "Eh, why not" (and origin=
ally,=20
"I should at least know _how_ to set it up") than actually having stuff=
 I=20
need the security for anyway.
