Why?

I don't really understand the purpose of splitting up the batch.
The only possible error handling on a full-stripe write is:
 - fail a device, or
 - record a bad-block.

The first case affects all stripes in a batch equally so there is no need to
split it up.
The second case it is probably best to record the bad blocks while iterating
through the batch in handle_stripe_clean_event().

What exactly do you expect to happen after the stripes in a batch after they
have been split up?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
