The bdi is only around if the device is open, either through a device
node, or through a blkdev_get from a file system.  If you get duplicate
names that means you're trying to allocate a new gendisk while the old
one is still around.

In theory you're fine once the device gets ->release called.

Except that we can hold sysfs reference to the qeue, eww.  So for now
try to follow the dm model, but I'll need to add a callback to the
queue called once the request_queue actually is released for this.
