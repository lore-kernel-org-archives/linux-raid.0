Good point, yes I can see why they need that.  In that case, the
storage device can't just silently truncate a TRIM request; it would
have to expose to the OS its alignment requirements.  The risk though
is that more they try push this compleixity into the OS, the higher
the risk that the OS will simply decide not to take advantage of the
functionality.  Of course, there is the question why anyone would want
to build a software-raid device on top of a thin-provisioned hardware
storage unit.  :-)
