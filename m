Andrea's Cauchy matrix is compatible with the existing Raid6, so there
is no problem there.

I believe it would be a terrible idea to have an incompatible extension
- that would mean you could not have temporary extra parity drives with
asymmetrical layouts, which is something I see as a very useful feature.

Yes, that's right.
