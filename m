Hi Christoph, thanks for looking into this.
You're right, this series fixes both issues. The problem I see though
is that it relies
on legacy IO path removal - for v5.0 and beyond, all fine. But
backporting that to
v4.17-v4.20 stable series will be quite painful.

My fixes are mostly "oneliners". If we could get both approaches upstream,
that'd be perfect!
Cheers,


Guilherme
