mdadm doesn't wipe data and it isn't supposed to. Being able to create 
an array from drives with existing data is a feature.

It is the responsibility of the system administrator to handle drives 
with existing data, in the same way the administrator is expected to 
handle insertion of USB drives or external drives being powered on.
