Thanks both of you for your explanations

I might say that it seems to me a bad design: never before I saw a cache 
that is not updated by writes.
Here the cache content is *older* than the data on the real devices!?
if it was *newer*, there are known cases (writeback cache not flushed 
yet), but *older*... never seen.

Thanks
