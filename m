dm-flakey would allow more xfstests test cases to run.  I'd say that's
more important than linear or raid0.  ;-)

Also, the next step in this work is to then decide how to determine on
what numa node an LBA resides.  We had discussed this at a prior
plumbers conference, and I think the consensus was to use xattrs.
Toshi, do you also plan to do that work?

Cheers,
Jeff
