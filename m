I've rebased this patch against Jens' for-4.8/core (resolved conflict in
blk-merge.c) and pushed the result to this wip2 branch, feel free to use
it to resubmit for inclusion if/when that is the way forward, see:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=wip2&id=36cee4b1ddef0a46562045b421792a847c570b6b
