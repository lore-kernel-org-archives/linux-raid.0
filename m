I have to believe this was born out of code inspection rather than
actual need (due to crash, etc)?

The cleanup order isn't relevant.  The reference counting of a DM device
governs whether a DM device (and its associated 'struct mapped_device')
can be destroyed.  Please have a look at  __dm_destroy, particularly:
        * No one should increment the reference count of the mapped_device,
        * after the mapped_device state becomes DMF_FREEING.
