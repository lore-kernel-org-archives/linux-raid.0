I think that is because there were some key structure changes in dm-crypt
after I sent out v2. I have resolved them while working on v3. Please wait for
the next version of the patchset. I'll send it probably by next week.
I wanted to incorporate a few changes suggested by Herbert before sending them.

It was just an RFC patch, not ready for merging.

Thanks,
