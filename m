Well, it is good that there is no performance degradation but it
would be nice to have some user of it that proves it is really
working for your hw.

FYI - with patch that increases dmcrypt sector size to 4k
I can see improvement in speed usually in 5-15% with sync AES-NI
(depends on access pattern), with dmcrypt mapped to memory
it is even close to 20% speed up (but such a configuration is
completely artificial).

I wonder why increased dmcrypt sector size does not work for your hw,
it should help as well (and can be combiuned later with this IV approach).
(For native 4k drives this should be used in future anyway...)
