Hrm, I made sure there were no perf regressions when I wast testing this stuff,
though I think I only tested xfs and ext4.  Originally I had a test where if we
provided our own submit_io, so maybe as a workaround just make

if (dio->final_block_in_bio != dio->cur_page_block ||
                    cur_offset != bio_next_offset) 

look like this

if (dio->final_block_in_bio != dio->cur_page_block ||
    (dio->submit_io && cur_offset != bio_next_offset))

and that should limit my change to only btrfs.  I know why it could cause a
problem, but this change shouldn't be causing a 400% regression.  I suspect
something else is afoot here.  Thanks,

Josef
