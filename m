Hi Neil,

I wouldn't have offered to take on mdadm if I hadn't meant it, even if =
I
like making the wording sound silly :) I feel I can do a decent job at
it and the task should be reasonable in scope. If someone is dying to
take it on, I am not going to stand in their way, but I feel mdadm need=
s
a maintainer and it's a worthy effort.

We'll have to figure out the logistics, and I'd like to coordinate with
who takes on drivers/md

Cheers,
Jes
