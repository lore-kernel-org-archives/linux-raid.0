I've not performed head-to-head timed rebuild tests of mirror vs parity
RAIDs.  I'm making the elapsed guess for parity RAIDs based on posts
here over the past ~3 years, in which many users reported 16-24+ hour
rebuild times for their fairly wide (12-16 1-2TB drive) RAID6 arrays.

This is likely due to their chosen rebuild priority and concurrent user
load during rebuild.  Since this seems to be the norm, instead of giving
100% to the rebuild, I thought it prudent to take this into account,
instead of the theoretical minimum rebuild time.

But (when) will we have the code to fully take advantage of these?  It's
nearly 2014 and we still don't have a working threaded write model for
levels 5/6/10, though maybe soon.  Multi-core mainstream x86 CPUs have
been around for 8 years now, SMP and ccNUMA systems even longer.  So the
need has been there for a while.

I'm strictly making an observation (possibly not fully accurate) here.
I am not casting stones.  I'm not a programmer and am thus unable to
contribute code, only ideas and troubleshooting assistance for fellow
users.  Ergo I have no right/standing to complain about the rate of
feature progress.  I know that everyone hacking md is making the most of
the time they have available.  So again, not a complaint, just an
observation.
