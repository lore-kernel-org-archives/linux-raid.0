I'm still looking - running some basic tests on 4 filesystems over
half a dozen recent kernels to see what has been happening.

I have a suspicion that there a multiple problems.
In particular, XFS has a strange degradation which was papered over
by commit c8a4051c3731b.
I'm beginning to wonder if it was caused by commit 17bc6c30cf6bf
but I haven't actually tested that yet.
