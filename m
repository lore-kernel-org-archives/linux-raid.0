Not sure I understand the 'blocking' problem in this case.

We can build a bvec table from this req, and send them all
in send(), can this way avoid your blocking issue? You may see this
example in branch 'rq->bio != rq->biotail' of lo_rw_aio().

If this way is what you need, I think you are right, even we may
introduce the following helpers:

	rq_for_each_bvec()
	rq_bvecs()

So looks nvme-tcp host driver might be the 2nd driver which benefits
from multi-page bvec directly.

The multi-page bvec V11 has passed my tests and addressed almost
all the comments during review on V10. I removed bio_vecs() in V11,
but it won't be big deal, we can introduce them anytime when there
is the requirement.

Thanks,
Ming
