There are two things I'm not sure you covered.

First, disks which don't support flush but do have a "cache dirty" 
status bit you can poll at times like shutdown. If there are no drivers 
which support these, it can be ignored.

Second, NAS (including nbd?). Is there enough information to handle this 
"really rigt?"

Otherwise looks good as a statement of issues. It seems to me that the 
filesystem should be able to pass the barrier request to the block layer 
and have it taken care of, rather than have code in each f/s to cope 
with odd behavior.
