The patch assumes only one holder disk for a claimed dev, which is not true.
E.g. if there are multiple LVs on a PV.

In addition to that, since claiming is done in table constructor,
there can be 2 claim instances for a slave/holder pair at a time
when you load a table while there's already an active one.
E.g. if you do lvresize.
We need consideration for this, too.
