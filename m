Well, I did a simple test with dd reading, cause my engine limitation is 1M,
(1) so the time like below when handle 1M at one time.
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.0841235 s, 12.5 MB/s
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.0836294 s, 12.5 MB/s
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.0836526 s, 12.5 MB/s

(2) These handle 64K at one time * 16 times
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.0937223 s, 11.2 MB/s
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.097205 s, 10.8 MB/s
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.0935884 s, 11.2 MB/s

Here is a 10ms level difference, try to image if the hardware engine's
throughput is bigger than that. But like Jens said, we can measure it
by the performance data. Thanks.

OK.  But I think if it is that it should change the default limitation
for the DM device.
