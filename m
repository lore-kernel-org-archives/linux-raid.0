Okay, I see your point now. Thanks for pointing that out.

Hum. This brings up a lot of questions. Would you consider throttling an
appropriate solution to prevent error flooding? What would you use as a
base? A per device counter (which might be misleading if there are more
layers below)? A per filesystem counter (which might need
configurability)? Should those "counters" regenerate over time? Any
other approaches?
