Sure, a layering violation for an existing filesystem.  For btrfs, at
LSF'09, we briefly talked about breaking out more than just the
erasure codes from software-raid into a "libraid".  At some point in
the i/o path a btrfs stripe operation becomes indistinguishable from a
raid5,6 operation so at first glance there appears to be room to share
common infrastructure like portions of handle_stripe for example.
