Well there is precedent in how do the IPsec IV generation.  In
that case the IV generators too are completely specific to that
application, i.e., IPsec.  However, the way structured it allowed
us to have one single entry path from the IPsec stack into the
crypto layer regardless of whether you are using AEAD or traditional
encryption/hashing algorithms.

For IPsec we make the IV generators behave like normal AEAD
algorithms, except that they take the sequence number as the IV.

The goal here are obviously different.  However, by employing
the same method as we do in IPsec, it appears to me that you
can effectively process multiple blocks at once instead of having
to supply one block at a time due to the IV generation issue.

It doesn't have to live outside of dm-crypt.  You can register
these IV generators from there if you really want.
