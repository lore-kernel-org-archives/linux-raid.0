That's an interesting idea.  I suspect this could be done more  
efficiently by only journaling the parity block update, but there is  
no way for the journal to address this block.

That said, unfortunately Jody has no more time to work on these  
patches (due to data ordering requirements Lustre can't use them), and  
while they are functionally complete for RHEL5 + ext3, they need to be  
ported to 2.6.current and ext4 by someone or they will die a silent  
death.


Cheers, Andreas
