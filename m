As for (b), the "dd" with zeroing all the future mdadm components I'm
going to use for an MD device is quite time-consuming operation, mainly
for large devices.

And we don't need to do that full zeroing at all, what I'm after is to
have the wipefs-like functionality directly integrated into mdadm (that
functionality is already a part of libbblkid and it's very easy to use
it as a matter of fact). With this, we can detect and wipe all
signatures that blkid detects. The blkid is used as a primary source of
information when processing uevents to decide about further processing.
Once we wipe all that blkid can see, we make the device clear for udev
processing too and we don't end up automatically activating some old
garbage that we don't intend to actually based on these uevent hooks.
