MD RAID1/RAID10: Move some macros from .h file to .c file

There are three macros (IO_BLOCKED,IO_MADE_GOOD,BIO_SPECIAL) which are defined
in both raid1.h and raid10.h.  They are only used in there respective .c files.
However, if we wish to make RAID10 accessible to the device-mapper RAID
target (dm-raid.c), then we need to move these macros into the .c files where
they are used so that they do not conflict with each other.

The macros from the two files are identical and could be moved into md.h, but
I chose to leave the duplication and have them remain in the personality
files.
