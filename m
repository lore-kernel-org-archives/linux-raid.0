Yeah, Serge and I were just tossing that idea around on irc. If we can
make that work then it's probably the best solution.

From a naive perspective it seems like all we really have to do is make
the block device inode immutable to userspace when it is mounted. And
the parent block device if it's a partition, which might be a bit
troublesome. We'd have to ensure that writes couldn't happen via any fds
already open when the device was mounted too.

We'd need some cooperation from the loop driver too I suppose, to make
sure the file backing the loop device is also immutable.
