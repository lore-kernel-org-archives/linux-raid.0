Thank you for clarifying that part.:)
So, I hope we can consider algorithms like lmk and tcw too as IV generation
algorithms, even though they manipulate encrypted data directly?

I agree with this too, only problem with this is when multiple keys are involved
(where the master key is split into 2 or more), and the key selection is made
with a modular division of the (512-byte) sector number by the number of keys.

Sorry, but I didn't understand this part.

Thanks,
