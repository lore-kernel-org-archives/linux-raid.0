Hi Neil,

I've been maintaining the custom Linux kernels, custom MD and custom
mdadm since more than 4 years at ProfitBricks now. I've learned a lot
from you. Thank you very much for all the efforts! I will definitely
miss you in the MD/mdadm maintainer role. I especially like that you
care for all Linux distributions/kernel versions. That's what a real
upstream is about. I wish you all the best for the future!

Unfortunately my public activity has been very limited as company
interests always have priority. I would really like to help maintaining
MD/mdadm upstream but I would need an employer who pays me for that and
provides access to the required hardware.

In my leisure time I already maintain the upstream Linux memory scanner
project scanmem/GameConqueror.

Cheers,
Sebastian
