Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Recent breakage of DM RAID

There have been two commits that have broken DM RAID:
1) 773ca82 (v3.12-rc1) raid5: make release_stripe lockless
2) 566c09c raid5: relieve lock contention in get_active_stripe()

I've provided a patch for the first, but I don't have a patch ready for
the second yet.  Since 3.12 is alreay out, I figured I better send the
patch for the first problem now.

Simply creating a RAID 4/5/6 device via device-mapper (or LVM) is sufficent
to cause the hang to manifest.
