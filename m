Well, it is a bit more complicated, I agree, but the explanation I did:
"pairs, as long as possible, and then the rest in a group shifted 1."
Is done in just one line...

Well, my suggestion does make a difference, and it is not complicated,
and it moves redundancy to kind of raid-1+0 also for odd numbers.
And we are not going to do these changes very often. So why not do it now.
IMHO the patch will make it almost the same for redundancy
whether they use an even or an odd number of disks, making even/odd
a less concern. And some will use it, I know!

Sounds good!
