Also there're some conflicts in btrfs_end_empty_barrier():

...
static void btrfs_end_empty_barrier(struct bio *bio, int err)
{
	if (err) {
		if (err == -EOPNOTSUPP)
			set_bit(BIO_EOPNOTSUPP, &bio->bi_flags);
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		clear_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &bio->bi_flags);
	}
	if (bio->bi_private)
		complete(bio->bi_private);
	bio_put(bio);
}

Thanks,
