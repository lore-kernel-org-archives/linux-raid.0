Certainly possible, but it feels clumsy.  I'm not convinced it is a good id=
ea.

You can agree that I don't strongly disagree...

The main reason for the current implementation is that is currently
implemented.
Until an alternate implementation exists, it seems pointless to recommend
that people use it.
Maybe you are suggesting that dmraid should not support raid10-far or
raid10-offset until the "new" approach is implemented.
Maybe that is sensible, but only if someone steps forwards and actually
implements the "new" approach.
