Currently md raid0/linear are not provided with any mechanism to validate
if an array member got removed or failed. The driver keeps sending BIOs
regardless of the state of array members. This leads to the following
situation: if a raid0/linear array member is removed and the array is
mounted, some user writing to this array won't realize that errors are
happening unless they check dmesg or perform one fsync per written file.

In other words, no -EIO is returned and writes (except direct ones) appear
normal. Meaning the user might think the wrote data is correctly stored in
the array, but instead garbage was written given that raid0 does stripping
(and so, it requires all its members to be working in order to not corrupt
data). For md/linear, writes to the available members will work fine, but
if the writes go to the missing member(s), it'll cause a file corruption
situation, whereas the portion of the writes to the missing device aren't
written effectively.

This patch proposes a small change in this behavior: we check if the block
device's gendisk is UP when submitting the BIO to the array member, and if
it isn't, we flag the md device as broken and fail subsequent write I/Os.
If the array is restored (i.e., the missing array members are back) and
the array is restarted, the flag is cleared and we can submit BIOs normally.

With this patch, the filesystem reacts much faster to the event of missing
array member: after some I/O errors, ext4 for instance aborts the journal
and prevents corruption. Without this change, we're able to keep writing
in the disk and after a machine reboot, e2fsck shows some severe fs errors
that demand fixing. This patch was tested in ext4 and xfs filesystems.

v1 -> v2:
* Fail only WRITE requests (thanks Neil for the suggestion);
* Added handling for md-linear failures too (thanks Song for
the suggestion).
