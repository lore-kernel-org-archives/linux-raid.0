OK, so something as a function with a prototype like
"void md_is_broken(struct md_rdev *rd, const char *md_type)"
is good for you?
Then we can use that as the check if a member failed and in positive
case, we can print the message (if not printed before) and return to the
raid0/linear driver in order it fails the bio and returns.
I'd prefer keeping the bio out of the helper, agreed?

If you have suggestion for a better name, let me know.
Thanks,


Guilherme
