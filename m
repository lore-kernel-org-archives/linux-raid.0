This could work, but will require some refactors; it'll simplify the
check for a healthy array (no need for is_missing_dev() function) but
will complicate the criteria to clear MD_BROKEN and the detection of
more members failing (we would stop the detection after the 1st failure
if we only test MD_BROKEN).

We will always need to test the GENHD_FL_UP in some code path, to be
able to show users device recovered from a failure.
Where do you suggest to test this flag?

Thanks,


Guilherme
