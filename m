md raid1 has supported barriers since 2.6.17

But I'm not aware of any md work being done to support barriers in
other raid levels.  Judging by Neil Brown's thoughts on the matter
(from 2006) it would seem unlikely he is putting effort to it, please
see the following thread:

cc'ing linux-raid to see if others have more insight.
