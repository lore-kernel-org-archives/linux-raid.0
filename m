Personally, I don't care about that -- I'm utterly uninterested in the
legacy RAID-6 setup where it pretends to be a normal disk. I think that
model is as fundamentally wrong as flash devices making the similar
pretence.

I'm only interested in what we can use directly within btrfs -- and
ideally I do want something which gives me an _arbitrary_ number of
redundant blocks, rather than limiting me to 2. But the legacy code is
good enough for now=C2=B9.

When I get round to wanting more, I was thinking of lifting something
like http://git.infradead.org/mtd-utils.git?a=3Dblob;f=3Dfec.c to start
with, and maybe hoping that someone cleverer will come up with somethin=
g
better.

The less I have to deal with Galois Fields, the happier I'll be.

=C2=B9 Well, kind of. The xor_blocks() function will silently screw you=
 over
  if you ask it to handle more than 5 blocks at a time.
