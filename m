drivers/md/dm-raid.c is a device-mapper target that provides access to the MD personalities.  So far, MD's RAID 1/4/5/6 have been made available to the device-mapper interface through this module.  We are laying the ground work here for RAID10 to be made available in the same way.

You may wish to have a look at linux/Documentation/device-mapper/dm-raid.txt for additional information.  Also note that in "[PATCH 4 of 4] MD RAID10: Export md_raid10_congested", I referenced a couple of other times that these types of changes were necessary.

Thanks,
