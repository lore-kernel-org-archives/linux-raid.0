You wrote "commercial" but actually meant "proprietary".

And yes, there are fully GPLv2 modules out there which are
"commercial" (whatever that actually means) - even in the sense that
people and companies live (also) directly from it.

You may rewrite the whole mail with s/commercial/proprietary/. It is
then (more) correct and IMHO very probably also more clear where you are
heading.
And please don't mix license issues (what can I do with it and what not)
with commercial issues (how and how much money can I make out of it) -
these are two totally different and independent things.

Is there a "published API" apart from the pragmatic one: look into
the .h (and .c) files and find it but beware, it may change with the
next release?
I don't think so. And no, generated (or other) documentation does not
change that.

That's the big wish of the proprietary folks - have an in-kernel API
which allows proprietary kernel modules.
Google for it to find lots of discussions about this topic and opinions
on what's OK and what's not OK.

That has IMHO next to nothing to do if the module is a derivative work
of the kernel or not if you are a lawyer.
And there are several companies which play this game so you might want
to look how they try to handle that.
