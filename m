Thanks for the info. Well, I corrected the wikipedia description to the one that I 
suggested, as this was more in line with what I understood was the current implementation.
I have missed the email from Neil that you quoted above.
I believe it was me writing up the Wikipedia text anyway, at least I did all of
the initial writeup of the Wikipedia text on raid10.

And then I saw that you were implementing a description on raid10,far that
was less than optimal. That description should not be around as it is a flawed design.
(I did the design of raid10,far).
There  should only be one layout for "far". I think when we  discussed
the "far" layout initially, we were not aware of the consequences of the
layout then wrt how many disk failures the layout can survive..

I think the layout you described should not be promoted at all,
and only kept for backward compatibility. As there is no backward 
compatibility in your case I think it is an error to implement it.
I understand that you do not reuse any of the MD code here?

I hestitate now changing the wikipedia description of MD raid10,far back.
I fear that some implementers would code it as to that spec!
Well, there should probably be something about it, I will write
up something. 

The flaw is worse than Neil described, as far as I understand.
With n=2 you can in the current implementation only have 1 disk failing,
for any numbers of drives in the array. With the suggested layout
then for 4 drives you have the probability of surviving 66 % 
of 2 drives failing. This get even better for 6, 8 .. disks in the array.
And you may even survive 3 or more disk failures, dependent on the number
of drives employed. The probability is the same as  for raid-1+0

> When it is available to MD, I'll make it available to dm-raid also.

Please dont implement it in the flawed  way. It will just create a number of problems
for when to switch over and convert between the two formats, and then which should
be the default (I fear some would say the old flawed should be the default), and we need
to explain the two formats and implement two sets of repairs and so on.

Best regards
