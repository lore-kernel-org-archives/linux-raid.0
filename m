No, we have the same definitions of redundancy - just different
definitions of basic arithmetic.  Your definition is a bit more common!

My error was actually in an earlier email, when I listed the usable
capacities of different layouts for 20 x 1TB drive.  I wrote:

> raid10 = 10TB, 1 disk redundancy

Of course, it should be:

raid10 = 10TB, 1 disk redundancy
raid15 = 9TB, 3 disk redundancy
raid16 = 8TB, 5 disk redundancy


So it is your fault for not spotting my earlier mistake :-)

That is absolutely true, and I agree that it is very important when
setting up big arrays.  You have to make decisions like where you split
your raid1 pairs - putting them on different controllers/chassis means
you can survive the loss of a whole half of the system.  On the other
hand, putting them on the same controller could mean hardware raid1 is
more efficient and you don't need to duplicate the traffic over the
higher level interfaces.

But here we are looking at one specific class of failures - hard disk
failures (including complete disk failure and URE's).  For that, the
redundancy is the number of disks that can fail without data loss,
assuming the worst possible combination of failures.  And given the
extra stress on the disks during degraded access or rebuilds, "bad"
combinations are more likely than "good" combinations.

So I think it is of little help to say that a 20 disk raid 15 can
survive up to 11 disk failures.  It is far more interesting to say that
it can survive any 3 random disk failures, and (if connected as you
describe with two controllers and chassis) it can also survive the
complete failure of a chassis or controller while still retaining a one
disk redundancy.


As a side issue here, I wonder if a write intent bitmap can be used for
a chassis failure so that when the chassis is fixed (the controller card
replaced, the cable re-connected, etc.) the disks inside can be brought
up to sync again without a full rebuild.

Yes.
