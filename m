Can you help with estimation how many existing users need this kind of
functionality? One of them evdev, which has an open coded variant.

Also, pay attention to that fact we have already bitmap_parse_user()
and bitmap_parlelist_user() which are called by several users.

If the estimation will show something like 3+, it would definitely
make sense, otherwise, I wouldn't like spend time on it.
