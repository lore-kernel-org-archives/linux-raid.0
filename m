That was a tongue-in-cheek comment.  You're reading way too much into

I assume you mean allocate memory (the volatile kind).  That should wor=
k
the same between pmem and regular block devices, no?

What I was getting at was that applications may want to know on which
node their data resides.  Right now, it's easy to tell because a single
device cannot span numa nodes, or, if it does, it does so via an
interleave, so numa information isn't interesting.  However, once data
on a single file system can be placed on multiple different numa nodes,
applications may want to query and/or control that placement.

Here's a snippet from a blog post I never finished:

There are two essential questions that need to be answered regarding
persistent memory and NUMA: first, would an application benefit from
being able to query the NUMA locality of its data, and second, would
an application benefit from being able to specify a placement policy
for its data?  This article is an attempt to summarize the current
state of hardware and software in order to consider the above two
questions.  We begin with a short list of use cases for these
interfaces, which will frame the discussion.

=46irst, let's consider an interface that allows an application to quer=
y
the NUMA placement of existing data.  With such information, an
application may want to perform the following actions:

- relocate application processes to the same NUMA node as their data.
  (Interfaces for moving a process are readily available.)
- specify a memory (RAM) allocation policy so that memory allocations
  come from the same NUMA node as the data.

Second, we consider an interface that allows an application to specify
a placement policy for new data.  Using this interface, an application
may:

- ensure data is stored on the same NUMA node as the one on which the
  application is running
- ensure data is stored on the same NUMA node as an I/O adapter such
  as a network card, that is a producer of data stored to NVM.
- ensure data is stored on a different NUMA node:
  - so that the data is stored on the same NUMA node as related data
  - because the data does not need the faster access afforded by local
    NUMA placement.  Presumably this is a trade-off, and other data
    will require local placement to meet the performance goals of the
    application.

Cheers,
Jeff
