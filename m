I think that's not a particularly good definition.
MAINTAINERS describes the M: entry as:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>

That _person_ is generally responsible for vetting patches
and bug fixing.

Not given there's a specific L: entry that's described

	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area

Then you don't have a maintainer

Patches are sent to lkml.
