Why conflate the two? Something being a background task is orthogonal to
whether it is being read sequentially or not.

Eric> So what are our options?  What might be the best way to do this?

For the SCSI I/O hints I use the idle I/O priority to classify
backups. Works fine.

Eric> Are FADV_NOREUSE/FADV_DONTNEED reasonable candidates?

FADV_DONTNEED was intended for this. There have been patches posted in
the past that tied the loop between the fadvise flags and the bio. I
would like to see those revived.

The idle class explicitly does not have a priority.
