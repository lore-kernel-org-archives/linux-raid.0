That link only points to an email about an oops.

Diggin through that thread, the only objection I have seen is about
the fact that you have to generate a fresh IV for each sector, which
is precisely what I'm suggesting that you do.

IOW, implement the IV generators in the crypto API, and then you can
easily generate a new IV (if necessary) for each sector.

Of course you would do CBC in 512-byte blocks, but my point is that
you should do this in a crypto API algorithm, rather than dm-crypt
as we do now.  Once you implement that then dm-crypt can treat
every algorithm as if they supported bulk processing.
