So what we want is a very easy way of determining, "is this device being used by the device mapper layer"?   If it is, then it's probably not the droids we are looking for.   We'll keep looking at the rest of the block devices in the system, and when we find the dm-concatenated devices, we can properly identify it.

open(O_EXCL) will fail on a block device if it is being used by anything else
- a filesystem or a dm target or an md array or ....

So if the *only* thing you want is "is this currently an active part of
something else", then O_EXCL works since 2.6.0 (I think).
