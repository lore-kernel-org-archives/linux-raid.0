There is a fair amount of code duplication between dm-linear.c and this
new target.

Something needs to give, ideally you'd factor out methods that are
shared by both targets, but those methods must _not_ introduce overhead
to dm-linear.

Could be that dm-linear methods just get called by the wrapper
dm-sec-erase target (more on the "dm-sec-erase" name below).

All of this extra context and explanation needs to be captured in the
actual patch header.  Not as a tangent in that "cut" section of your
patch header.

Shouldn't this target be implementing all that is needed for
REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE support?  And the resulting DM device would
advertise its capability using QUEUE_FLAG_SECERASE?

And this is why I think the target should be named "dm-sec-erase" or
even "dm-secure-erase".

You should probably be using your own bioset to allocate these bios.

In general, performing memory allocations to service IO is something all
DM core and DM targets must work to avoid.  This smells bad.

At a minimum this should be GFP_NOIO.  You don't want to recurse into
block (and potentially yourself) in the face of low memory.

Perfect example of why this new target shouldn't be doing a point in
time copy of dm-linear code.

With 4.20's upcoming zoned device changes dm-linear no longer even has
an end_io hook (which was introduced purely for REQ_OP_ZONE_REPORT's
benefit).
