Hi Song, thanks for the feedback! After changing the patch and testing a
bit, it behaves exactly as you said, we got either valid data read from
the healthy devices or -EIO for the data tentatively read from the
failed/missing array members.

So, I'll resubmit with that change. Also, I've noticed clearing the
BROKEN flag seem unnecessary, if user stops the array in order to fix
the missing member, it'll require a re-assembly and the array is gonna
work again.

Do you / Neil considers this fix relevant to md/linear too? If so, I can
also include that in the V2.
Thanks,


Guilherme
