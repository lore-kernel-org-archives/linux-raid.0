I have seen the papers; I'm not sure it really makes that much 
difference.  One of the things that bugs me about these papers is that 
he compares to *his* implementation of my optimizations, but not to my 
code.  In real life implementations, on commodity hardware, we're 
limited by memory and disk performance, not by CPU utilization.
