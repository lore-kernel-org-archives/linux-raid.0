Thanks Neil,

Yes, 3-of-5 should probably go in sooner rather than later.  Waiting on the others shouldn't hurt.

5-of-5: changing the check to 'saved_raid_disk >= 0' would be fine, but I think I should initialize 'saved_raid_disk' to -1 in dm-raid.c then normally.  Right now, an nominal initial value is not set - meaning it is '0'.  (When a device comes back from a failure, 'saved_raid_disk' is assigned its old position.)
