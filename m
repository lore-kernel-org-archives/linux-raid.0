Hi Mikulas,

How does this relate to the previous patch you made to dm-crypt?  How best
should I test this?  It looks like the dm-crypt patch fixed the problem.

Should I test by applying this patch ONLY and reverting the dm-crypt patch?
(i.e. does this patch also fix the problem.)  Or should I just test with
both patches applied simultaneously?
