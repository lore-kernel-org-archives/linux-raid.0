Hi Heinz,
 I don't object to these patches if you will find the exported functionality
 useful, but I am a little surprised by them.

 I would expect that dm-raid wouldn't ask md to 'takeover' from one level to
 another, but instead would
   - suspend the dm device
   - dismantle the array using the old level
   - assemble the array using the new level
   - resume the dm device

 The reason md needs 'takeover' is because it doesn't have the same
 device/target separation that dm does.

 I was particularly surprised that you wanted to use md/raid0.c  It is no
 better than dm/dm-stripe.c and managing two different stripe engines under
 LVM doesn't see like a good idea.

 Is there some reason that I have missed which makes it easier to use
 'takeover' rather than suspend/resume?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
