Andrea, I didn't take your comment as an accusation of any kind - there
is no need for any kind of apology!  It was was merely a statement of
fact - I picked powers of 4 as an obvious extension of the powers of 2
in raid6, and found it worked well.

And of course, in the open source world, copying of code and ideas is a
good thing - there is no point in re-inventing the wheel unless we can
invent a better one.  Really, I /should/ have read the ZFS
implementation and copied it!

mvh.,

David
