Thus my understanding that entire stripe will either be discarded or
not by the mdraid layer.

And if a discard comes along from above that is smaller than a stripe,
then it will tossed by the mdraid layer.

And if it is not aligned to the stripe geometry, then the start/end of
the discard area will be adjusted to be stripe aligned.

And since the mdraid layer is not currently planning to track what has
been discarded over time, when a re-shape comes along, it will
effectively un-trim everything and rewrite 100% of the FS.

The same thing will happen if a drive is cloned via dd as happens
pretty routinely.

Overall, I think Linux will need a mechanism to scan a filesystem and
re-issue all the trim commands in order to get the hardware back in
sync a major maintenance activity.  That mechanism could either be
admin invoked.or a always on maintenance task.

Personally, I think the best option is a background task (kernel I
assume) to scan the filesystem and issue discards for all the data on
a slow but steady basis.  If it takes a week to make its way around
the disk/volume, then it takes a week.  Who really cares.

Once you assume you have that background task in place, I'm not sure
how important it is to even have the filesystem manage this in
realtime with the file deletes.
