I tested this patch by:

1.  Building v4.7-rc1 from Torvalds git repo.  Confirmed that original bug
    still occurs on Ubuntu 15.10.

2.  Applying your patch to v4.7-rc1.  My kill sequence no longer works,
    and the writeback cache is now successfully flushed to disk, and the
    cache can be detached from the backing device.

3.  To check data integrity, copied 250 MB of /dev/urandom to some file
    on main volume.  Then, dd copy this file to /dev/bcache0.  Then,
    detached the cache device from the backing device.  Then, rebooted.
    Then, dd copy /dev/bcache0 to another file on main volume.  Then,
    diff the files and confirm no changes.

So it looks like it works, based on this admittedly brief testing.  Thanks!

Best regards,

James Johnston
