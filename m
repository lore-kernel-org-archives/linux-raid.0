No problem.

In which case, you can specify the parameter twice:
"... rebuild 0 rebuild 1..."
No problem there, I think.

This is kept in the superblock (forthcoming patches).  In the case  
where metadata devices are not specified (or can't be specified, as in  
this initial set of patches), the user has two choices: 1) allow the  
array to completely resync, or 2) specify [no]sync.

Is there something more to this, or is the above comment suitable for  
this also?

I had this in seconds originally, but device-mapper tables already  
have a precedent for specifying things in ms.  We don't want to have  
each target pick their own units.  (A similar thing can be said for  
values given in sectors.  We may have wanted kiB or B, but sectors is  
the standard.)

This is a conscious choice.  The offset was discarded because it is  
unneeded.
