Hi Peter,

The Cauchy matrix has the mathematical property to always have itself
and all submatrices not singular. So, we are sure that we can always
solve the equations to recover the data disks.

Besides the mathematical proof, I've also inverted all the
377,342,351,231 possible submatrices for up to 6 parities and 251 data
disks, and got an experimental confirmation of this.

The only limit is coming from the GF(2^8). You have a maximum number
of disk = 2^8 + 1 - number_of_parities. For example, with 6 parities,
you can have no more of 251 data disks. Over this limit it's not
possible to build a Cauchy matrix.

Note that instead with a Vandermonde matrix you don't have the
guarantee to always have all the submatrices not singular. This is the
reason because using power coefficients, before or late, it happens to
have unsolvable equations.

You can find the code that generate the Cauchy matrix with some
explanation in the comments at (see the set_cauchy() function) :

Ciao,
Andrea
