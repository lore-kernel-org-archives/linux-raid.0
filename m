Sorry for delay, I tried to compile it.
It doesn't crash now, but it also does not work.

You usage of IV in XTS mode is not correct - it cannot just work this way,
you have to initialize IV after each block. And just one write not aligned
to your large XTS block will corrupt it.

Did you tried to _read_ data you write to the device?

See this test :

# create  device with your patch
$ echo "test"|cryptsetup create -s 512 -c aes-xts-bulk tst /dev/sdg

# prepare random test file
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/src.img bs=1M count=16

# now copy the file to the plaintext device and drop caches
$ dd if=/src.img of=/dev/mapper/tst bs=1M count=16

$ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# and verify that we are (not) reading the same data ...

$ dd if=/dev/mapper/tst of=/dst1.img bs=1M count=16

$ sha256sum /src.img /dst1.img 
5401119fa9975bbeebac58e0b2598bc87247a29e62417f9f58fe200b531602ad  /src.img
e9bf5efa95031fdb5adf618db141f48ed23f71b12c017b8a0cbe0a694f18b979  /dst1.img

(I think only first page-sized block is correct, because without direct-io
it writes in page-sized IOs.)


... or just try to mkfs and mount it
$ mkfs -t ext4  /dev/mapper/tst 

mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Creating filesystem with 262144 4k blocks and 65536 inodes
...

$ mount /dev/mapper/tst /mnt/tst
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/tst,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error


You approach simply does not work. (It will probably work for ECB mode but it is
unusable in real world.)


Anyway, I think that you should optimize driver, not add strange hw-dependent
crypto modes to dmcrypt. This is not the first crypto accelerator that is just not
suited for this kind of use.

(If it can process batch of chunks of data each with own IV, then it can work
with dmcrypt, but I think such optimized code should be inside crypto API,
not in dmcrypt.)
