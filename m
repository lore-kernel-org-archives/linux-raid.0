The rebuild time of a parity array normally has little to do with CPU
overhead.  The bulk of the elapsed time is due to:

1.  The serial nature of the rebuild algorithm
2.  The random IO pattern of the reads
3.  The rotational latency of the drives

#3 is typically the largest portion of the elapsed time.

This depends greatly on one's normal operation.  In general, for most
users of parity arrays, any full array operation such as a rebuild or
reshape is far more taxing on the drives, in both power draw and heat
dissipation, than 'normal' operation.

That may very well be, but it doesn't change #2,3 above.

I don't like it either.  It's a compromise.  But as RAID1/10 will soon
be unusable due to URE probability during rebuild, I think it's a
relatively good compromise for some users, some workloads.

Capacity yes, drive count, no.  Drive capacities are increasing at a
much faster rate than our need for storage space.  As we move forward
the trend will be building larger capacity arrays with fewer disks.

This is the classic mirror vs parity argument.  Using 1 more disk to add
parity to striped mirrors doesn't change it.  "Waste" is in the eye of
the beholder.  Anyone currently using RAID10 will have no problem
dedicating one more disk for uptime, protection.

Neither of those has any advantage over multi-parity.  I suggested this
approach because it retains all of the advantages of RAID10 but one.  We
sacrifice fast random write performance for protection against UREs, the
same reason behind 3P.  That's what the single parity is for, and that
alone.

I suggest that anyone in the future needing fast random write IOPS is
going to move those workloads to SSD, which is steadily increasing in
capacity.  And I suggest anyone building arrays with 10-20TB drives
isn't in need of fast random write IOPS.  Whether this approach is
valuable to anyone depends on whether the remaining attributes of
RAID10, with the added URE protection, are worth the drive count.
Obviously proponents of traditional parity arrays will not think so.
Users of RAID10 may.  Even if md never supports such a scheme, I bet
we'll see something similar to this in enterprise gear, where rebuilds
need to be 'fast' and performance degradation due to a downed drive is
not acceptable.
