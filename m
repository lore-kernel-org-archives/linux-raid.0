I'm working on up streaming a driver for Arm  CryptoCell that supports
this and working
offline to get Binoy a board to test this with. Alas, shipping crypto
HW has its fair share
of regulatory challenges... :-)

I can certainly understand if you don't wont to take the patch until
we have results with
dm-crypt itself but the difference between 8 separate invocation of
the engine for 512
bytes of XTS and a single invocation for 4KB are pretty big.

From what I know of HW engines I'd be surprised if this is in any way
unique to CryptoCell.

I never said anything about embedded :-)

It really is an observation about overhead of context switches between
dm-crypt and
whatever/wherever you handle crypto - be it an off CPU hardware engine
or a bunch
of parallel kernel threads running on other cores. You really want to
burst as much as
possible.

I see what you're saying. We need number to back this up.

I don't think anyone is interested in these modes. How do you support
XTS and essiv in
a generic way without supporting this broken modes is not something
I'm clear on though.

Of course, the benefits at large needs to outweigh the cost. But I
don't think functioning
better when working on large bursts is in any way special to specific HW.

Indeed, I wonder if we can show a benefit for just cryptd use case.
I'll look into that.

Thanks,
