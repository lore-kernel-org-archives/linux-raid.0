But as Milan pointed out, that larger block size doesn't work if you 
process requests with different sizes - the data encrypted with one 
request size won't match if you decrypt them with a different request 
size.


XTS with larger block could work if it were possible to use arbitrary 
initial tweak - the function crypt() in crypto/xts.c calculates the 
initial sector tweak by encrypting the iv:

tw(crypto_cipher_tfm(ctx->tweak), w->iv, w->iv);

and then calculates each cipher block's tweak by multiplying the tweak by 
a constant polynomial (alpha):

gf128mul_x_ble(s.t, s.t);	(s.t is the same as w->iv)


If we could supply the tweak directly, we could use larger sectors in 
dm-crypt.

For example, we could use 64k XTS sectors and if the user is accessing 1k 
offset in the sector, we could calculate initial sector tweak
	tw(crypto_cipher_tfm(ctx->tweak), w->iv, w->iv);
and then multiply it by alpha^(1024/16) (because we are 1024 bytes into 
the sector and xts block size is 16). That would make it possible to use 
larger encryption requests and the data would match regardless of request 
size.

But the Linux crypto API doesn't allow this - the code that would multiply 
the tweak after initial encryption isn't there (maybe we could get this 
behavior by modifying ctx->tweak to point to a null cipher, but it is 
dirty hack to poke into private crypto structures).

Does the hardware encryption you are optimizing for allow setting 
arbitrary tweaks in XTS mode? What is the specific driver you are 
optimizing for?


Another possibility is to use dm-crypt block size 4k and use a filesystem 
with 4k blocksize on it (it will never send requests not aligned on 4k 
boundary, so we could reject such requests with an error).
