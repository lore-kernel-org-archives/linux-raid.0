Thing is, I do not observe any in-file random data corruptions which would
point to a problem at a lower (block-device) level, so I do not think it is=
 a
RAID or HDD problem.

The breakage seemed to be on the filesystem logic level, perhaps something =
to
do with allocation of space for new files? And since I immediately just bef=
ore
that, made two operations possibly affecting it (tune2fs stride size + onli=
ne
grow with resize2fs) that's why I thought this might be an ext4 problem.

While still in the same session, I then re-copied the affected files replac=
ing
their "shortened" copies, and they were written out fine the second time. A=
nd
after a reboot, no more file truncations are observed so far.

No, there weren't any errors in dmesg, or on the same console where 'cp' wo=
uld
output its errors.

It is an mdadm RAID6, and it does not report any problem. It was running in=
 a
degraded state for only a short time (less than a day). And AFAIK running
degraded without one disk is not a dangerous or risky situation with RAID6.

I have unmounted it and ran fsck just now. Admittedly there was a long time
since the last fsck.

No, I don't use LVM there.
