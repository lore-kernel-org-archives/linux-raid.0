Point taken.  I already wanted to complain about the mess due to the bi=
o
error abuse with it's own values in DM in the first posting, guess I
need to add that to the second one.  I don't think overloading common
interfaces with your private error codes is a good idea, but let's
leave that for a separate discussion.

I think the code is better than what it was before, but it's still
a bit of a mess.  What do you think of the patch below which I'd
like to add before the big bi_error patch as a preparatory one?

=46YI, that wasn't a foldable patch but updated hunks of the old one.  =
Not
really a problem, but a little confusing.

Subject: dm: use a single error code variable in clone_endio
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3DUTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

clone_endio currently uses two variables for tracking error state, with
values getting bounce=D1=95 forth and back between the two, which makes=
 the
code hard to read.
