Thanks for reply, Steve!

parameters are pretty trivial, (rw,insecure) for exports, and defaults whil=
e mounting via ``mount host:/path /path'' command.

Yes. That sounds interesting, since XFS works fine with there partitions.
Also, I must say it's WD20EARS drives (with 4kb sector size, though parted =
says it's 512b).

I also tried another NFS daemon implementation (cvs version, not .22) -- un=
fsd (unfs3).
It mounts ok, but when I try to write any file to the server -- I get the s=
ame error (Stale NFS file handle).

And on the server side in dmesg I see this:

--
NFS: server 172.17.2.2 error: fileid changed
fsid 0:f: expected fileid 0x2033, got 0xb6d1e05fa150ce09

looks like NFS protocol doesn't like something in partitioned software RAID.
