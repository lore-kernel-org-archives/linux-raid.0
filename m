There's some miscommunication here, it seems.  mdadm does NOT wipe the
primary device in a mirror during create, nor data blocks in a
parity-based array's stripes, but it DOES wipe the 2nd and following
copy of all mirrored blocks, and DOES wipe all parity and Q blocks.
This behaviour is really important for later consistency when degraded,
and for parallelizing reads of mirrors.

I think a case can be made for wiping it all during create, for
consistency with other kernel behaviour.  If you allocate memory for
userspace, or or create a new file on a filesystem with a specific size,
linux goes to some length to deliver zeros in both cases.  Arguably, it
should do so in MD, too.

However, changing the default behaviour would fit Linus' definition of a
regression, I would think.
