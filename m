Thanks Neil,

1st patch:
I'll move 'MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED' into mddev_resume and keep FROZEN in raid_resume.

2nd patch:
I pulled out the 'degraded' accounting.  I'll switch from setting Faulty in 'read_sb_page' to calling 'md_error' in a separate patch.

Apologies for the the flush question.  I had confused device-mapper's use of "flush" and "lockfs", thinking that a 'flush' would perform the 'lock_fs'.  It does not, so we should expect the file system to be caching some bits.  (Snapshots use the 'lock_fs' feature to quiesce the file system before the snapshot is finalized.  I think it would make sense to do this when a mirror image is split-off also, but that's now a userspace issue.)

I have a few other patches I pass along as well,
 brassow
