There is a cache associated with /dev/sda and /dev/sdb which md does not ma=
ke
any use of.  The filesystem doesn't use it either.  It is only used from
user-space reads from /dev/sda or /dev/sdb.
When you "sync" the filesystem, the new data is written out, but the cache =
it
not changes.  When you then read from /dev/sda, you might get cached data,
which is stale.

blockdev --flushbufs
clears that cache so that subsequent reads come from the device, not from t=
he
cache.

i.e. it is read caching that is causing the confusion you see, not write
caching.
