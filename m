It's not just more memory per page, but also worse code all over the
VM. long long 32bit code is generally rather bad, especially on
register constrained x86.

But I think the fsck problem is a show stopper here anyways.
Enabling a setup that cannot handle IO errors wouldn't 
be really a good idea.

In fact this problem already hits before 16TB on 32bit.

Unless people rewrite fsck to use /dev/shm >4GB swapping
(or perhaps use JFS which iirc had a way to use the file system
itself as fsck scratch space)
