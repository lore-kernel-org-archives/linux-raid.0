The missed module alias was an oversight, thanks for catching that.  =
(Similar - as you can see from this patch - to the oversight I had when =
introducing raid1. :)  I have gone back and forth on whether to include =
the alternate "raid1e" or not.  There are different RAID1E algorithms, =
as described in the kernel doc.  Perhaps there should also be aliases =
similar to raid5 and raid6 - like raid1e_as (i.e. RAID1E - Adjacent =
Stripe), etc.  However, there are several combinations that don't have a =
real name.  Any thoughts?  I would be just fine leaving "raid1e" out as =
I would leaving it in.  These days, RAID10 is really a subset of RAID1E =
- perhaps I should be considering taking "raid10" out.  ;)

I like your suggestion of changing the parameter names.  I've found the =
original names somewhat confusing.  ('far_offset' seems to imply to me =
that the copy would not be the very next stripe, but _offset_ somehow - =
it seems to have the reverse meaning to me.  I think this comes from the =
fact that it acts as a modifier to 'far_copy'.)  I toyed with a couple =
different ways of doing this but figured it was best to just go along.  =
Anyway, what you are suggesting seems to be:
	raid10_copies <number> (Default: 2)
	raid10_layout <string> (Default: "near"/"adjacent")
Where <string> could be "near", "far", "offset" and "some-future-thing". =
 That seems nice to me and seems to clear up some of the confusion =
caused by "far_offset" seeming to be a modifier to "far_copies".

Let me know what you think about the above, and I'll get v2 ready.

 brassow

P.S.  While it doesn't affect this singular patch, I see people posting =
their set of patches as a reply to the summary '0 of' patch.  This keeps =
things together better, and I'll assume this is the way I should post =
from now on.=
