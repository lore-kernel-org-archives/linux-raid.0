  Well, the problem is in inconsistency of caches. There is one cache -
page cache - used by filesystems to read & write file data which is
addressed by inode, offset. And there is another cache caching the whole
device addressed by device, offset. It would be too costly to keep both
these caches consistent and most people don't care so we don't.

  BTW, if you configured KVM to use direct IO or virt IO when accessing the
devices (a good idea anyway), you wouldn't have the problems either.
