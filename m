That's right. But we'll not introduce the duality things, cause we
will remove the bio based things in dm-crypt if the request based
things are accepted.

Yes, the request based requires more memory than bio based, but it is
not too much. And the request based has a big performance improvement.

Like I said above, we plan to remove the bio based things which are
not good support for hardware engine encryption. And I'll show you the
performance data to prove the request things have a good performance.

OK. The CONFIG is not suitable here. I'll remove the CONFIG with just
enable the request based things.

OK. I'll show you the performance data. Thanks for your comments.
