In the context of BTRFS the only costs are development of the new
erasure code and integration as well as the possible cost of carrying
around two erasure codes (one for MD backwards compatibility, one for
BTRFS).

The availability of arbitrary M of N erasure codes is more attractive
for BTRFS than MD because of the increased granularity. I.e. with
BRTFS you might want a smaller stripe width because some sub-volume
spans fewer spindles, or increased parity blocks you need increased
redundancy for some small set of files.

On the other hand=E2=80=94 for performance reasons if you want addition=
al
redundancy beyond 'RAID6' you might just be better off writing more
duplicates of the data blocks instead of additional RS syndromes since
while the additional data blocks are not optimal from an error
recovery perspective they will provide a performance gain of being
able to spread reads out across additional disks.
