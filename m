I am not sure if I understand it correctly, but multiple holders/slaves
links are very useful in userspace to present device dependences.

We just implemented lsblk command in util-linux which simple prints
tree according to these links, so dependendes of DM/MD/whatever devices
can be printed without using any system specific callbacks, just using
sysfs. See http://karelzak.blogspot.com/2010/12/lsblk8.html

Whatever changes are needed, please keep this functionality, it can be useful.

Thanks,
Milan
