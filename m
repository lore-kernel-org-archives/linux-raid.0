I'll queue a patch to rename 'error' to 'error_bits' where appropriate.

If you're referring to the mix of error variables I totally agree.  Jus=

don't think we need the extra branching.

Yeap, should have been clearer they were meant to replace your hunks.

Unfortunately by dropping the original error (e.g. -EREMOTEIO) on the
floor (in the 'if (endio) {' branch) you're breaking the REQ_WRITE_SAME
check.

Your new bi_error patch gets away with the redundant error code cleanup
because we can directly check the bio's bi_error for -EREMOTEIO.  So
feel free to fold the simplified 'if (error > 0 && error !=3D DM_ENDIO_=
REQUEUE) {'
in to your new patch -- but not seeing the point of making this prep
patch in advance.
