I put in the flush disk stuff at the suggestion of James Bottomley. In
fact the text for the justification in 608aeef17a91747d6303 is mostly
his.  The idea is to get errors reported immediately rather than waiting
around for them to eventually get flushed and to make sure stale data is
not kept around.  Certainly, at a minimum, not keeping stale data around
seems valuable to me. 

What parts of the original justification did you think are unconvincing?
Note that the flush for growing the device is really only there for the
degenerate case where someone might shrink then grow a device
(admittedly, the user probably deserves to get data corruption/security
holes in such a case).
