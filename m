Thanks for the suggestion.  The documentation is correct, as far as I can tell.  What you take issue with is that a higher level of redundancy can be achieved by laying down the copies differently.  Neil touched on that in this message:
	http://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&m=134136516029779&w=2

When it is available to MD, I'll make it available to dm-raid also.
