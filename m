There is a reason why it is fairly uncommon in kernel.
Initially it was used more widely, but then there was a decision to
drop all uses of this feature. Namely:
Linus: "We should definitely drop it. The feature is an abomination".
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/23/500
I really don't understand why you cling onto this last use of the
feature. Having a single use of a compiler extension on an error path
of a non-mandatory driver does not look like a great idea to me. Let's
just kill it off outside of clang discussion.
