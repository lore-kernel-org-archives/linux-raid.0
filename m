this doesn't match what I have seen

wtih barriers it's perfectly legal to have the following sequence of 
events

1. app writes block 10 to OS
2. app writes block 4 to OS
3. app writes barrier to OS
4. app writes block 5 to OS
5. app writes block 20 to OS
6. OS writes block 4 to disk drive
7. OS writes block 10 to disk drive
8. OS writes barrier to disk drive
9. OS writes block 5 to disk drive
10. OS writes block 20 to disk drive
11. disk drive writes block 10 to platter
12. disk drive writes block 4 to platter
13. disk drive writes block 20 to platter
14. disk drive writes block 5 to platter

there is nothing that says that when the app finishes step #3 that the OS 
has even sent the data to the drive, let alone that the drive has flushed 
it to a platter

if the disk drive doesn't support barriers then step #8 becomes 'issue 
flush' and steps 11 and 12 take place before step #9, 13, 14
