Partially agree, I've never really liked the two methods we have where
the light light version was originally meant for stacked devices but
gets used elsewhere now too. It also causes IO scheduling problems, and
then you get things like request based dm to work around that.

But the idea is really to move more towards private queueing more
localized, the multiqueue setup will really apply well there too. I'm
trying to flesh out the design of that, ideally it would be nice to
unify the different bits we have now.

But agree on pulling the stacked bits into some lower part, like the
gendisk. It would clean that up nicely.
