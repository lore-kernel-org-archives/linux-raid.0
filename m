It can already happen that one device writes the sector and other not if 
the power is interrupted. And all RAID implementations already deal with 
it by resynchronizing the modified areas in case of crash. So they could 
resynchronize modify-while-write cases as well, with the same code.

... or I don't know if MM maintainers want to add locking to the pages 
that are under a write. Personally, I wouldn't do it.

There would be no problem with fsync. Fsync writes the synced data to both 
devices. So after a crash you can select any of the devices as a resync 
master copy, and you get the data that you wrote before sync() or fsync().
