*Exactly*

To put it another way:  You can't safely access ext filesystems via
raw devices in two systems.  The kernel cache won't be synchronized,
and you almost certainly *will* corrupt the contents.

You can unmount the FS then pass the raid to the VM, or dismantle the
raid as well, and let the VM assemble it.

There are cluster filesystems that allow multiple mounts of shared
devices, though.  I haven't played with them, so you might want to
do some googling.
