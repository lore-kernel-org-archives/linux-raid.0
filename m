It is an enforced (perhaps unnecessary) constraint that the array length be divisible by the number of data devices.  I'm not accounting for chunk boundaries - I leave that to userspace to configure and MD to catch.

I'm not changing any sizes.  I'm finding a value for mddev->dev_sectors (what should I set it to if not the above?), which is the size of each device as computed from the total array size.  If the value can't be computed evenly, then an error is given.  I'm not sure what you are suggesting my alternative is when you say, "keep it out of dm-raid"...  I think this is the least I can do in dm-raid.
