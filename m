Well, it doesn't work at all anyways due to the fsck problem.

You would need to get <~2.5GB for 32bit. In practice that's
the limit you have there.

You could, but I suspect it would be cheaper to just use a
64bit system than to rewrite fsck. 64bit is available
for a lot of embedded setups these days too.
