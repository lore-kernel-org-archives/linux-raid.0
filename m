What's the spec of these devices? How long are they expected to last?

Other recent posts on this (linux-raid) mailing list refer to tests on
SSDs that indicates their typical life is way beyond their nominal life,
and that in normal usage they are actually likely to outlive "spinning
rust".

Looking at the results, the FIRST drives only started failing once
they'd written some 700 Terabytes. How long is it going to take you to
write that much data over a SATA3 link?

Cheers,
