Well, what's described in barrier.txt is the current implemented
semantics and what filesystems expect, so we can't change it underneath
them but we definitely can introduce new more relaxed variants, but one
thing we should bear in mind is that harddisks don't have humongous
caches or very smart controller / instruction set.  No matter how
relaxed interface the block layer provides, in the end, it just has to
issue whole-sale FLUSH CACHE on the device to guarantee data ordering on
the media.

IMHO, we can do better by paying more attention to how we do things in
the request queue which can be deeper and more intelligent than the
device queue.

Thanks.
