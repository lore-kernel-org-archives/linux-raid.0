A while back, we tried to address this by changing the alloc functions to
take rw argument and set it (as per Jens suggestion). I guess the patch did
not make it in. Please check:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/11/275

And the follow ups. If needed, I can dust up that patch and resend it.

There are cases where we found it really beneficial to know the rw field to
decide if the can be really merged or not.
