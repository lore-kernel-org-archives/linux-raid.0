That's right.

Yes, that sounds reasonable.

OK.

You're right, this patch is used for hw crypto acceleration. As you
know some hardware engine may handle the IV for one bulk data, so the
software just generate one initial IV. Qualcomm's implementation for
xts mode just use one initial IV for one bulk data to improve the hw
engine efficiency.
(https://github.com/major91/Zeta-Chromium-N5/blob/master/drivers/md/dm-req-crypt.c)
So like you said I can change the IV name as 'aes-xts-bulk' or
something else to avoid the ESSIV, cause this can really gain big
improvements for hw engine.
