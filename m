Thanks for the feedback Neil! I thought about it; it seemed to me better
to deny/fail the reads instead of returning "wrong" reads, since a file
read in a raid0 will be incomplete if one member is missing.
But it's fine for me to change that in the next iteration of this patch.

Cheers,


Guilherme
