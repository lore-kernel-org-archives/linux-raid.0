Hi Neil,

had a first go reading through your patch series w/o finding any major
issues. The only important feature for an initial release which needs
adding (as you mentioned) is (persistent) dirty log support.

Because you're using a persistent bitmap in the MD RAID personalities,
this looks like a bit more surgery to factor it out to potentially
enhance dm-log.c. For an initial solution we can as well just go with
MDs existing bitmap while keeping the dm-raid456 ctr support for
explicit dirty logging in order to avoid compatibility issues (there's
obviously no parameter to support bitmap chunk sizes so far).

Reshaping could be triggered either preferably via the constructor
involving MD metadata reads to be able to recognize the size change
requested or the message interface. Both ctr/message support could be
implemented sharing the same functions. Enhancements in the status
interface and dm_table_event() throwing on error/finish are mandatory if
we support reshaping.

A shortcoming of this MD wrapping solution vs. dm-raid45 is, that there
is no obvious way to leverage it to be a clustered RAID456 mapping
target. dm-raid45 has been designed with that future enhancement
possibility in mind.

Will try testing your code tomorrow.

Regards,
Heinz
