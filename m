That is impossible. The page cache can answer questions like "where is 
page 0x1234 from inode 0x5678 located on disk?" But it can't answer the 
reverse question: "which inode and which page is using disk block 
0x12345678?"

Furthermore, with device mapper you can stack several mapping tables each 
on other --- and again --- device mapper can't solve the reverse problem 
it can't tell you which filesystem is using block X.
