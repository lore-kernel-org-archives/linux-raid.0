Nack.

DM isn't unique here.  XFS does the same thing:

XFS FILESYSTEM
P:      Silicon Graphics Inc
M:      Dave Chinner <david@fromorbit.com>
M:      xfs@oss.sgi.com
L:      xfs@oss.sgi.com
...

There really is more important stuff to deal with than bothering about
MAINTAINERS entries like this.  Please stop.
