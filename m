Your testing methodology is neither scientific nor thorough, and your
information is incomplete.  This may be why you're receiving no replies...

You suggest the problem is related to md because taking it out of the
loop shows "less breakage" of your streaming application.  However,
you're using XFS.  Thus this is applicable:

"As of kernel 3.2.12, the default i/o scheduler, CFQ, will defeat much
of the parallelization in XFS. "

http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_I_want_to_tune_my_XFS_filesystems_for_.3Csomething.3E

It may simply be that the CFQ/XFS problem is manifesting itself more
prominently with md than single disk in your case.

Also, are you aligning XFS to the md geometry?  mkfs.xfs should have
aligned to md automatically but sometimes this may break.

I suggest testing with the deadline elevator.  I'd also suggest
benchmarking your disks individually and benchmarking the md0 RAID5
array and providing the results.  It's possible your RAID5 array is
actually performing slower than a single disk, but you don't know it
because you've not tested it.  What's your stripe_cache_size value?  The
default may be too low for your disks/array.  What is the configuration
of your RAID5 array?  Chunk size?

You said a single drive was streaming 250 MB/s.  That's impossible
unless you're using SSD.  If what you really meant is that you told your
streaming program to do 250MB/s then of course you'll get buffering as
the disks can't keep up with that rate, only about half that for a
single SATA drive.  You did not mention SSDs.  You didn't mention rust.
 You did not mention drive make/model/size.
