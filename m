This is a rebase of the series I sent earlier, based on the
very latest from Linus, which included my first patch.

The first fixes a problem that patch introduced, and so should go to
Linux promptly.
The others are more general improvements and can go in the normal
course of events.

It is possible that the changes to btrfs and xfs can just be dropped
as a subsequent patch will be needed to revert them anyway.  They are
there only to be able to say that "blk: make the bioset
rescue_workqueue optional." doesn't change any functionality at all.

Thanks,
NeilBrown

      blk: Ensure users for current->bio_list can see the full list.
      blk: remove bio_set arg from blk_queue_split()
      blk: make the bioset rescue_workqueue optional.
      blk: use non-rescuing bioset for q->bio_split.
      block_dev: make blkdev_dio_pool a non-rescuing bioset
