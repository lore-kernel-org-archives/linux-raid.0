A rescuing bioset is only useful if there might be bios from
that same bioset on the bio_list_on_stack queue at a time
when bio_alloc_bioset() is called.  This never applies to
q->bio_split.

Allocations from q->bio_split are only ever made from
blk_queue_split() which is only ever called early in each of
various make_request_fn()s.  The original bio (call this A)
is then passed to generic_make_request() and is placed on
the bio_list_on_stack queue, and the bio that was allocated
from q->bio_split (B) is processed.

The processing of this may cause other bios to be passed to
generic_make_request() or may even cause the bio B itself to
be passed, possible after some prefix has been split off
(using some other bioset).

generic_make_request() now guarantees that all of these bios
(B and dependants) will be fully processed before the tail
of the original bio A gets handled.  None of these early bios
can possible trigger an allocation from the original
q->bio_split as they are either too small to require
splitting or (more likely) are destined for a different queue.

The next time that the original q->bio_split might be used
by this thread is when A is processed again, as it might
still be too big to handle directly.  By this time there
cannot be any other bios allocated from q->bio_split in the
generic_make_request() queue.  So no rescuing will ever be
needed.
