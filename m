Well mdadm --create already initializes the array properly, so problem 
solved.

I saw this request repeatedly when I worked at Red Hat, and I got it 
again from my replacement who had been asked to do the same dirty work 
that I refused to do. Now we see the same request from you, so it is 
rather easy to assume it came from there again.

I am not sure what you mean by old data here?

This is exactly what it does. There is no difference to how mdadm does 
it compared to how it works if you plugin a new USB drive which may have 
data on it or if you assemble an iSCSI device that has metadata on it. 
Are you also going to suggest the iSCSI tools have a wipe metadata mode 
added to them?

Yes there is a risk that creating an array that exactly matches old 
metadata despite those signatures haven gotten wiped. This is a feature, 
people use it to recover their data, and it is not going to be removed.

If you don't want this, disable automatic processing of udev events that 
may do something on top of it. This is what anaconda should be doing.
