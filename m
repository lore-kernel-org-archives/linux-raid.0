I really like this clean up.
It is unfortunate that the patch is so big, but I guess it has to be.

It mostly looks good, but review is hard and testing is harder :-(

I found:

This introduces a use-after-free.  put_buf(r1_bio) can  result in bio_put on
'bio'.
It is safe to move the put_buf call after the md_done_sync(), but it is
probably best to leave the 'update' variable as it.  i.e. Just change:

-	int uptodate = test_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &bio->bi_flags);
+	int uptodate = !bio->bi_error;


I can't see any other problems with the md changes.
