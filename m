 for an even number of far copies, we should shift "near_copies + 1" - unle=
ss (far_copies =3D=3D (raid_disks / near_copies)), in which case it should =
be simply "near_copies".  This should provide maximum redundancy for all ca=

evice stride", or dev_stride.  Here are a couple examples:

Hi Jon,
 This looks good for 4 devices, but I think it breaks down for e.g. 6 devic=
es.

I think a useful measure is how many different pairs of devices exist such
that when both fail we lose data (thinking of far=3D2 layouts only).  We wa=
nt to
keep this number low.  Call it the number of vulnerable pairs.

With the current layout with N devices, there are N pairs that are vulnerab=
le.
(x and x+1 for each x).  If N=3D=3D2, the two pairs are 0,1 and 1,0.  These
pairs are identical so there is only one vulnerable pair.

With your layout there are still N pairs (x and x+2) except when there are 4
devices (N=3D2), we get 0,2 1,3 2,0 3,1 in which case 2 sets of pairs are
identical (1,3 =3D=3D 3,1 and 2,4=3D=3D4,2).
With N=3D6 the 6 pairs are=20
0,2 1,3 2,4 3,5 4,0 5,1
and no two pairs are identical.  So there is no gain.

The layout with data stored on device 'x' is mirrored on device 'x^1' has
N/2 pairs which are vulnerable.=20
An alternate way to gain this low level of vulnerability would be to mirror
data on X onto 'X+N/2'  This is the same as your arrangement for N=3D=3D4.
For N=3D=3D6 it would be:

A  B  C  D  E  F
G  H  I  J  K  L
....
D  E  F  A  B  C
J  K  L  G  H  I
...

so the vulnerable pairs are 0,3 1,4 2,5
This might be slightly easier to implement (as you suggest: have a
dev_stride, only set it to raid_disks/fc*nc).

>=20
> This should require a new bit in 'layout' (bit 17) to signify a different=
 calculation in the way the copy device selection happens.  We then need to=
 replace 'd +=3D geo->near_copies' with 'd +=3D geo->dev_stride' and set de=
v_stride in 'setup_geo'.  I'm not certain how much work it is beyond that, =
but I don't *think* it looks that bad and I'd be happy to do it.

I'm tempted to set bit 31 to mean "bits 0xFF are number of copies and bits
0xFF00 define the layout of those copies".. but just adding a bit17 probably
makes more sense.

If you create and test a patch using the calculation I suggested, I'll be
happy to review it.

 simply allow "near" for now?

That's up to you.  However it might be sensible not to rush into supporting
the current far and offset layouts until this conversation has run its cour=
se.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
