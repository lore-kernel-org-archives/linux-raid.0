Good point.
It would also help us we the device-mapper redesign agk and myself=20
discussed at LSF. Having a block_device_ops.submit function would
allow us remap the actual request queue generically; and we would=20
even be able to address more than one request queue, which sounds=20
awfully similar to what Jens is trying to do ...
