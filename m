I think that we are generally fine with the RAID5/6 support given a=20
small number of drives. The fancier erasure encodings are much more=20
interesting when you have a large number of drives - for example, we=20
just ordered 4 shelves of SATA drives (15/shelf) that will be driven by=
=20
a single server. You can certainly imagine profiling a lot of=20
interesting variations with that many things to play with.
