Any I/O operation after DM suspend is race condition and could cause
data lost.

You are expecting that machine resumes always at 100% and correctly. Bu=
t
this is not truth in real world. There are planty of users who reported
lot of random problems with suspend or hibernate...

If disks are synced before any DM suspend operation then we have higher
chance of preventing data corruption.

I still think that correct order is only:

* freeze processes (which doing continous I/O)
* fs & disk sync
* DM suspend
* wipe crypto keys
* enter hibernate
