It's not a hard error. If you wrote 896K in the example above, I'd
really expect the return value to be 896*1024. The API is hard to use
efficiently, if that's not the case.

Don't invent something new for this, the mechanism already exists for
returning a short read or write. That's how all of them have worked for
decades.

It should return 128*1024, since that's how much was successfully done
from the start offset. But yes, this is exactly the point that I brought
up, and why contesting Shaohua's suggestion to perhaps treat splits
differently should not be discarded so quickly.
