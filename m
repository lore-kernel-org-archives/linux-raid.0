Well, shame on them for developing out-of-tree, looks like they are 
reaping all the benefits of that.

Guys, we need some numbers, enough with the hand waving. There's no 
point discussing this further until we know how much of a difference it 
makes to handle X MB chunks instead of Y MB chunks. As was previously 
stated, unless there's a _substantial_ performance benefit, this 
patchset isn't going anywhere.

If there is a huge benefit, we can look into ways of making it actually 
work. That may not even be a request interface, it could just be proper 
utilization of plugging for in-dm bio merging.
