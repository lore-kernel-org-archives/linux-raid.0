OK. I think I find something need to be point out.
1. From the IO block size test in the performance report, for the
request based, we can find it can not get the corresponding
performance if we just expand the IO size. Because In dm crypt, it
will map the data buffer of one request with scatterlists, and send
all scatterlists of one request to the encryption engine to encrypt or
decrypt.  I found if the scatterlist list number is small and each
scatterlist length is bigger, it will improve the encryption speed,
that helps the engine palys best performance. But a big IO size does
not mean bigger scatterlists (maybe many scatterlists with small
length), that's why we can not get the corresponding performance if we
just expand the IO size I think.

2. Why bio based is slower?
If you understand 1, you can obviously understand the crypto engine
likes bigger scatterlists to improve the performance. But for bio
based, it only send one scatterlist (the scatterlist's length is
always '1 << SECTOR_SHIFT' = 512) to the crypto engine at one time. It
means if the bio size is 1M, the bio based will send 2048 times (evey
time the only one scatterlist length is 512 bytes) to crypto engine to
handle, which is more time-consuming and ineffective for the crypto
engine. But for request based, it can map the whole request with many
scatterlists (not just one scatterlist), and send all the scatterlists
to the crypto engine which can improve the performance, is it right?

Another optimization solution I think is we can expand the scatterlist
entry number for bio based.
