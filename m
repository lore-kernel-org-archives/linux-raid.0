I'm not sure if read-ahead would solve such a problem, if indeed this is
a possible problem.  AFAIK the RAID5/6 drivers process stripes serially,
not asynchronously, so I'd think the rebuild may still stall for ms at a
time in such a situation.

Given the frequency of RAID5 double drive failure "save me!" help
requests we see on a very regular basis here, it seems pretty clear this
is exactly what many users do.

We seem to have regular reports from DIY hardware users intentionally
using mismatched consumer drives, as many believe this gives them
additional protection against a firmware bug in a given drive model.
But then they often see multiple second timeouts causing drives to be
kicked, or performance to be slow, because of the mismatched drives.

In my time on this list, it seems pretty clear that the vast majority of
posters use DIY hardware, not matched, packaged, tested solutions from
the likes of Dell, HP, IBM, etc.  Some of the things I've speculated
about in my last few posts could very well occur, and indeed be caused
by, ad hoc component selection and system assembly.  Obviously not in
all DIY cases, but probably many.
