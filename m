For a RAID block device (such as Linux software RAID) read-ahead should work 
well.  For a RAID type configuration managed by the filesystem where you might 
have different RAID levels in the same filesystem it might not be possible.

It would be a nice feature to have RAID-0 for unimportant files and RAID-1 or 
RAID-6 for important files on the same filesystem.  But that type of thing 
would really complicate RAID rebuild.

I've had that happen in my own RAID-1 and had reports of the same from other 
people.  My problem was that one of the disks was a WD "Green" drive that 
aggressively parked the heads.  When I replaced the array the disk in question 
had parked it's heads about a million times more than it was supposed to but 
it still worked.

I think that if you want to buy two different disks from your local discount 
store then you are likely to end up with one that's not well suited to server 
use because they often don't have more than two types of disks on offer.
