After lots of debugging and dumping file system information. I found th=
at=A0 super block is being corrupted=A0 during SATA dma transfer.=A0 I =
am using PCI-E based SATA card to attach hard disks. Looks with 64k pag=
e size SATA DMA seems to be stressed so much compared to 4k page size. =
I used another SATA card which is more stable(it does not use=A0 libata=
). It worked finw with RAID-5 and 64k page size.
=A0 I have used a small C program to create w2GB size file and read it =
back and check the data consistency. So far no errors found. I also use=
d IO meter test , which worked fine too.=20
All thank you very much for the suggestions and responses.
Regards,
Marri

It means it will be flushed to disk, it does not mean that when you rea=

that will come off disk, if it is still in memory then it will come out=

to come off of disk again.

How much memory does your test machine have?

None of the benchmarks I am familiar with actually confirm that the dat=

good, the only way one of the benchmarks will fail is if the file table=
 gets=20
corrupted, and they may run in cache.

I would write directly to the /dev/mdx a specific pattern (a stream of =
binary=20
numbers from 1 ... whatever works fine), and then read that back and se=
e how=20
things match or don't.=A0 csum *can* fail, and if you have enough memor=
y then any=20
corruption actually on disk *WON'T* be found until somethings causes it=
 to be=20
ejected from cache, and then later re-read from disk.
