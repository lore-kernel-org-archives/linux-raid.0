The argument is the bitmask of xfeatures that are present.  0 is an
empty bitmask, i.e. no xfeatures are present.

I can rename it to xfeatures_present and/or document the argument
explicitly in the function comment, if that would help.

I'm not sure what this question is asking, but UML indeed doesn't
implement cpu_has_xfeatures().  Currently most of the AVX optimized code
isn't enabled on UML, which avoids this limitation.  The RAID code is
different though, as it's enabled on UML.

First, the code being added *is* to fpu__init_system_xstate().  Do you
think it needs to be moved later in the function, and if so why?

Second, clearing xfeatures is the opposite of what's needed.

(It's also already there.  See loop with the comment
"Clear XSAVE features that are disabled in the normal CPUID".)

What's needed is clearing X86_FEATURE_* flags based on missing
xfeatures.
