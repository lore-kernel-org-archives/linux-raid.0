No, this is getting rediculous now.  Please stop the insanity.

DM_PARAMS_KMALLOC and DM_PARAMS_VMALLOC are mutually exclussive --
always will be.  Sprinkling defensive code around isn't high on my list
of changes I'm interested in.

At some point I'll stage the original change from Sudip for 4.4 but I'm
re-writing the subject and header to not be so alarmist (this is more to
do with eliminating a conditional than anything else).  There is _zero_
potential for a double-free with the current code.

Mike
