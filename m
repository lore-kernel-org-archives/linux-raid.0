Regardless of which target(s) grow DAX support the most pressing initia=
l
concern is getting the DM device stacking correct.  And verifying that
IO that cross pmem device boundaries are being properly split by DM
core (via drivers/md/dm.c:__split_and_process_non_flush()'s call to
max_io_len).

My hope is to nail down the DM core and its dependencies in block etc.
Doing so in terms of dm-linear doesn't seem like wasted effort
considering you told me it'd be useful to have for pmem devices.

How does the associated NUMA node relate to this?  Does the
DM requests_queue need to be setup to only allocate from the NUMA node
the pmem device is attached to?  I recently added support for this to
DM.  But there will likely be some code need to propagate the NUMA node
id accordingly.
