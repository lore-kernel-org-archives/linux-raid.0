My fault.  I sent these two patches to dm-devel and failed to CC linux-raid or you.

Agk hasn't pushed these two yet and we should probably wait for that to happen.  The above two patches are necessary for this patch, but are dependent upon other patches that agk has staged at the moment.  The timing is not working out well, and we'll have to wait.

I'll pull the division out of the conditional so that it's a little more visible.  Once agk has pushed the aforementioned patches, I'll repost this patch with that change as 'v5'.

I don't want to belabor the issue - especially since you are kind enough to be accommodating, but I don't know how I can get by without calculating and setting 'mddev->dev_sectors'.  MD can't get that information from anywhere else (when setting up RAID through DM).  The main point is to compute sectors_per_dev, but secondarily I am checking for other conditions - like not aligning on chunk boundaries or not being evenly divisible.  Failure to set sectors_per_dev - or set it correctly - results in an ill-sized array (mddev->array_sectors).  The per device value is not passed in via DM table either - it must be computed.  So, I don't understand why it is pointless.
