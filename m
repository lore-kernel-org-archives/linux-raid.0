I don't mind this, but it seems a policy decision that the kernel does
not need to make.  A sufficiently sophisticated user could cope with
DAX being available at varying LBAs.  Would it be sufficient to move
this policy decision to userspace tooling?

I had dm-linear and md-raid0 support on my list of things to look at,
did you have raid0 in your plans?
