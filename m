This BUG_ON is caused if your file system writes blocks in sizes less 
than your page size. I will fix that before I attempt to upstream this 
driver assuming it gets accepted. If you can make your file system have 
4k blocks, you should be able to proceed (I hit this when I created a 
16MB ext4 fs on a loopback device)

So long as the file system supports fstrim, it should work. If the file 
system creates a lot of churn say by running garbage collection, I'd not 
recommend it. And I really don't see the use case if the file system has 
any sort of snapshot capability - that will always be a superior 
solution to a block level one IMO.

I'm not the ideal person to answer that question, but yes, I believe 
performance is an issue, along with the lack of file based encryption.

Well this question remains with any snapshot system, and indeed is there 
even before you have snapshots. There are really only two choices - 
throw away the snapshot and keep going, or fail the update and revert 
(with presumably the intent of freeing up more space and trying again.) 
Which we choose would be a policy decision - my goal would be to make 
sure either option is possible.

Yes, absolutely, but for the moment it's a work in progress and it 
contains an assumption about IO accesses being page aligned that is the 
reason for the failure you are seeing.

Yes, and I will be uploading that. For the moment it is embedded in some 
Android specific code. It won't take long to extricate it though. It's 
actually very simple.
