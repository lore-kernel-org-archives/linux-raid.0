Maybe this is just reporting bias - people are quick to post about
problems such as slow rebuilds, but very seldom send a message saying
everything worked perfectly!

There /are/ reasons why parity raid rebuilds are going to be slower than
mirror rebuilds - delays on one disk reading is one issue, and I expect
that simultaneous use of the array for normal work will have more impact
on parity raid rebuild times than on a mirror array (certainly compared
to raid10 with multiple pairs).  I just don't think it is quite as bad
as you think.
