Neil,

That fixed it - I no longer see any BUG()s or hangs in any of my tests.

I simply move the device_lock to cover the whole 'if (atomic_read(&sh->count)) ... else' conditional.  Seems that the sh->count (and other related bits) are being changed between the time it is checked and the time the lock is acquired.

If I had to guess, I'd say it was possible to have the following condition:
Thread1-1: get_active_stripe(): 'if (atomic_read(&sh->count))' => FALSE
	Thread2-1: Acquire 'device_lock'
	Thread2-2: Enter release_stripe_list
	Thread2-3: Clear STRIPE_ON_RELEASE_LIST while in release_stripe_list
	Thread2-4: call __release_stripe->do_release_stripe->atomic_dec_and_test(&sh->count)
	Thread2-5: Exit release_stripe_list
	Thread2-6: Release 'device_lock'
Thread1-2: Acquire 'device_lock'
Thread1-3: check !STRIPE_ON_RELEASE_LIST --> call BUG();

Right now, get_active_stripe is checking 'count' and then waiting for the lock.  The lock in the current case is simply allowing more time to set the condition that we BUG on.  Moving the lock ensures that 'count' is checked properly along with STRIPE_ON_RELEASE_LIST after they have been manipulated.

If you think the analysis is correct, I can try to clean-up the language a little bit and submit the patch.
