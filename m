Well (b) sounds a lot saner than either of those. Simply revert to a
state that is sub-optimal but has bounded memory use and reserve that
memory up-front. That way you can always get out of a tight memory spot.

Its what the block layer has always done to avoid the memory deadlock
situation, it has a private stash of BIOs that is big enough to always
service some IO, and as long as IO is happening stuff keeps moving fwd
and we don't deadlock.

Filesystems might have a slightly harder time creating such a bounded
state because there might be more involved like journals and the like,
but still it should be possible to create something like that (my swap
over nfs patches created such a state for the network rx side of
things).

Also, we cannot let our fear of crappy userspace get in the way of doing
sensible things. Your example of write(2) returning -ENOMEM is not
correct though, the syscall (and the page_mkwrite callback for mmap()s)
happens before we actually dirty the data and need to write things out,
so we can always simply wait for memory to become available to dirty.
