Hmmm... that's already possible with the existing holders symlinks,
right?  As Kay said in another message, I don't think we can do
anything about the symlinks at this point.  It already has userland
users, so we'll have to maintain them and there's no reason to create
something else for the same functionality.

It's silly that there's no way to tell whether the device is mounted
from a given block device but then again we've been working around it
by reverse mapping it till now so unless there's a new requirement
maybe it's okay as it is now.

Ideally, it would have been nice and more fitting with the whole bd
claim API if we just exported single attribute which identifies the
current holder supplied at the time of claiming (just the kernel
identifier in string), so that we can forward-map the exclusive opener
in general instead of having to reverse-map it for everything other
than md/dm.

Thank you.
