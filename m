Sure, but this is theory. Does it really work on some hw already?
Do you have performance measurements or comparison?

It is not only embedded crypto, we have some more reports in the past
that 512B sectors are not ideal even for other systems.
(IIRC it was also with AES-NI that represents really big group of users).

I saw few version of that. There was a very hacky way to provide request-based dmcrypt
(see old "Introduce the request handling for dm-crypt" thread on dm-devel).
This is not the acceptable way but definitely it points to the same problem.

IIRC the problem is performance, if we can solve it by some generic way,
good, but for now it seems to be a big change and just hope it helps later...

For XTS you need just simple linear IV. No problem with that, implementation
in crypto API and hw is trivial.

But for compatible IV (that provides compatibility with loopAES and very old TrueCrypt),
these should be never ever implemented again anywhere.

Specifically "tcw" is broken, insecure and provided here just to help people to migrate
from old Truecrypt containers. Even Truecrypt followers removed it from the codebase.
(It is basically combination of IV and slight modification of CBC mode. All
recent version switched to XTS and plain IV.)

So building abstraction over something known to be broken and that is now intentionally
isolated inside dmcrypt is, in my opinion, really not a good idea.


But please do get me wrong,  I do not want to block any improvement.

But it seems to me that this thread focused on creating nice crypto API interface
for FDE IVs instead of demonstration that the proposed solution really solves
the performance issue.
And not only for your hw driver, maybe other systems could benefit from the better
processing of small requests as well.
