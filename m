That makes a lot of sense.  The original design used something similar to
your second flag to do all the resync work.  I changed to an IOCTL approach
because there's no good way for a flagged IO to return "the resync you
requested could not be done so don't skip the automated resync."  But with
your suggestion, there's no need to explicitly skip the automated resync at
the end either - it just won't act on those blocks, assuming all blocks
were previously written with the first flag.

I don't like the IOCTLs either :)

Yes, it needs to be a READ flag to avoid an unnecessary read-write cycle.
The list of declare blocks in the ext3 journal just lists the block
numbers, not their contents (this is equivalent to data=ordered, not
data=journaled).

It would be nice to also have a WRITE flag though, for those cases
(metadata) where we do know what's being written to the block.

In any case, I think it's less confusing to have two flags: the "don't
worry about this block for now" flag and the "resync this block now" flag.

There's still one complication though, and an IOCTL may still be necessary:
at fsck time, we need to perform a journal recovery from e2fsck (userland.)
Clearly, resyncing the declared blocks (plus the journal and affected
metadata blocks) must be done before e2fsck does any writes to these
blocks.  An IOCTL seemed to be the best way to do that, but I'm open to
other suggestions.

I'll send a new patchset, hopefully today.
