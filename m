In what way it's not secure deletion?

It's secure deletion by overwriting discarded data instead of leaving it
as is. Thus it's secure deletion in some way. Level of security and
applicability (disks choice) is to be determined by the end user.
Because nobody could guarantee absolute security. Some three letter
agencies require just one pass of overwrite, some say that more than one
pass does not increase security. Some hardware disks advertising secure
deletion may do not much more than this target. Thus 'secure erase' is
applicable in that way too.

dm-erase or dm-wipe? dm-discerase? But still provide REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE
support?
