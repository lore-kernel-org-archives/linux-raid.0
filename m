For a 4k block size filesystem.

If I use 64k block size directories (which XFS can even on 4k page
size machines), the maximum transaction reservation goes up to at
around 3MB, and that's just for blocks being _modified_. It's not
the limit on the amount of memory that may need to be allocated
during a transaction....

Right, it usually is a lot less, but one of the big problems is that
during low memory situations memory reclaim of the metadata page
cache actually causes _more_ memory allocation during tranactions
than otherwise would occur.......

Cheers,

Dave.
