NAK.
First, I don't like the cast.
Second ask yourself: what if you compile on a 64 bit architecture ?
Third, I don't like void* arithmetics, some compilers might refuse it.

And as a last comment, is it "virtual" contiguity you're looking after, physical
contiguity, or dma_addr_t contiguity ?

As I'm still having difficulities to understand, please explain to me :
 - what is a dynamic sg_table
 - how it works
 - if it's "struct sg_table", how the field of this structure are different when
   it's a dynamic sg_table from a "static sg_table" ?

So how do you unmap this scatterlist once you've lost the number of mapped
entries ?

I think we'll come back to this once I understand how a "dynamic" sg_table is
different from a "static" one.
