But assuming we have hardware accelerator that know to handle the IV genera=
tion for each sector, it will make sense to send out to the hardware the ma=
ximum block size as this will allow us to better utilize the hardware and o=
ffload the software. So if possible we need to provide generic interface th=
at will be able to optimize the hardware accelerates.
