Good, it was my thinking if using dm-dirty-log interface, that there are
some MD bitmap code valuables we could factor out (bitmap flushing
enhancements?).

Ok.

Yes, that can be additional ctr variable parameters allowing for a
compatible enhancement.

One possibility could be using variable parameters from free #8 on:

o to_raid_type		# may be existing one; eg. raid6_zr
o to_chunk_size		# new requested chunk size in sectors
o old_size		# actual size of the array
o low_to_high/high_to_low # low->high or high->low addresses

ti->len defines the new intended size while old_size provides the actual
size of the array.

Makes sense. I was also thinking about tying stripe invalidation to lock
state changes.

Yes, an exclusive DLM lock.

When a dm-raid45(6) instance tries to reclaim either lock *after* it had
to drop it before, it has to invalidate the respective stripe date.

We don't use the DLM from DM yet, but essentially: yes, you'ld call
dlm_new_lockspace(), dlm_lock(..., DLM_LOCK_{CR|EX}, ...), ...

Of course such locking has to be abstracted in dm-raid456 in order to
plug in NULL, clustered, locking modules.
