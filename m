My original concern is a device failure can causes some stripes fail but some
not, eg, get rdev returns NULL in ops_run_io for some stripes but not all of a
batch. There is no any locking, so seems possible. But you are right, the
stripes without error in ops_run_io will get an IO error eventually, the whole
batch stripes are still in the same state. So my concern is invalid, but I
forgot to reply the email, sorry.

The batch split is to handle IO error, eg, record bad-block and so on. I'm not
confident to change existing code to handle the error case, so I feel spliting
it and handling the stripe in normal way is the best thing to do. There
certainly might be better way. Again the device failure case should be ignored,
which I didn't realize originally.

BTW, can you apply the fix reported by Maxime, which is introduced by the batch patch.
