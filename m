Sorry, I was thinking of euid. So this may not be a problem.

But we generally do want backwards compatibility, and we want userspace
software to be able to expect the same behavior whether or not it's
running in a user namespaced container. Obviously we can't always have
things 100% identical, but we shouldn't break things unless we really
need to.

However it may be that this isn't actually going to break assumptions of
existing software like I had feared. My preference is still to not
change any userspace-visible behaviors since we never know what software
might have made assumptions based on those behaviors. But if you're
confident that it won't break anything I'm willing to give it a try.

A user must still be privileged to mount, even if only towards their own
user and mount namespaces. Maybe that's what you meant though and I just
misunderstood.
