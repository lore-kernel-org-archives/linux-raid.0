It is an enforced (perhaps unnecessary) constraint that the array length be divisible by the number of data devices.  I'm not accounting for chunk boundaries - I leave that to userspace to configure and MD to catch.

If the value can't be computed evenly, then an error is given.  I'm not sure what you are suggesting my alternative is when you say, "keep it out of dm-raid"...  I think this is the least I can do in dm-raid.

Sure.  It's the same calculation, but I can do it this way to make things clearer.  (Although, I probably wouldn't add the extra 'remainder' variable).

And this is because I am not taking chunk size into account?  For example, if I had:
	ti->len == 100 sectors
	chuck_size == 16 sectors
	raid10_copies == 2
	raid_devices = 4
I would not detect any problems with the code above, but the '50' sectors_per_dev is not evenly divisible by the chunk size and would result in "short" devices.  Each device would have 3 chunks each, not 3.125 chunks.  Thus, I would have to have something like:
if (rs->raid_type->level == 10) {
		/* (Len * Stripes) / Mirrors */
		sectors_per_dev = ti->len * rs->md.raid_disks;
		if (sector_div(sectors_per_dev, raid10_copies) ||
		    (sectors_per_dev & (rs->md.chunk_sectors - 1))) {
			rs->ti->error = "Target length not divisible by number of data devices";
			return -EINVAL;
		}
}

It would also result in an error, wouldn't it?  Should I care (read "allow") about configurations that have unused space in the array?

I can certainly add a check after md_run to ensure that mddev->array_size == ti->len.
