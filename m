The other option is to define non static functions in ppc440spe-adma.c
which are used in common
File adma.c . This way there will not be any warnings. Is this something
acceptable ?

Here is the break down

ppc440spe-adma.c: It will have all the 440spe SoC specific functions.
ppc4xx_adma.h will have the declarations from 440spe-adma.c as non static.
adma.c will have common functions which are independent of SoC.

Please suggest.
