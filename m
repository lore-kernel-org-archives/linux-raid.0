Actually driver works fine with/without
ASYNC_TX_ENABLE_CHANNEL_SWITCH enabled
so I am fine with removing dependency on this config option.

OK, I will make SBA_ENC as "static inline __pure" function.

I think I relied too much on checkpatch.pl to catch this
kind of coding-style issues.

I will fix this. Thanks for catching.

We have run stress tests on driver with multiple threads
trying to submit txn.

I will certainly try CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING to be
double sure.
