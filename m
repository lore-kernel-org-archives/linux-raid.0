I'm wondering if a command line like this would be acceptable.

Format is:
  dm="<dev_name> <uuid> <mode>,  <table>[, <table>][; <dev_name>
<uuid> <mode>,  <table>[, <table>]][; ... ]"

where:
  <dev_name> ::=  The device name
  <uuid>          ::=  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx | "none"
  <mode>        ::= "ro" | "rw"
  <table>         ::= <start sector> <end sector> <target name>
<target parmaters>

An example of booting to a linear array:

 dm="lroot none rw, 0 2097152 linear /dev/sda2 0, 2097152 2097152
linear /dev/sda3 0, 4194304 2097152 linear /dev/sda4 0"

Equivalent dmsetup command:

echo -e "0 2097152 linear /dev/sda2 0"\\n"2097152 2097152 linear
/dev/sda3 0"\\n"4194304 2097152 linear /dev/sda4 0" | sudo dmsetup
create lroot

An example of multiple device-mappers, with the dm="..." contents shown
here split on multiple lines for readability:

    vroot none ro,
      0 2097152 verity 1 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3 4096 4096 262144 1 sha256 \
      289b52edac1ac4f4c32c8f765795615a85d4daa454677d21a6d8767c4627dc48 \
      632d7fe427a23a8e88493c553298a779997478a143d86da5d56a65db8a1f2a38;
    vram none rw,
      0 32768 linear 1:0 0,
      32768 32768 linear 1:1 0

Thanks,
 Enric
