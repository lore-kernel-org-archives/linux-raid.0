Ah, I did not know that ext2 was doing sub-block writes. This may be
something to address in the ext4 code (and other file systems), as
a lot of flash storage devices (SD cards and eMMC) get really slow
when you do writes smaller than 4K because of the internal
read-modify-write cycle. Ideally you want to always drive those
using 64K writes (for reads, it doesn't matter much).

For hard drives, there are still a couple of older models that have
native 512 byte sectors, but the majority of new drivers also
prefers 4K writes. SSDs are typically optimized for 4K writes because
that is what they expect software to do, but they use larger writes
internally.
