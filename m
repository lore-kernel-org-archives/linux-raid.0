Ok, to be fully precise there are 3 different cases (depending on config options):

1) refcount_t = atomic_t and in this case yes, nothing prevents increment, but no
 protection is given, so we hope such cases are disabled for any distros that care about
security

2) CONFIG_FULL_REFCOUNT is on and refcount_t uses arch. independent implementation
In lib/refcount.c. In this case refcount_inc() won't increment from zero. It is really more
than just a WARN(), increment fails inside refcount_inc_not_zero() used underneath. 

3) arch. dependent implementation is used for refcount_t. Here different options are
possible based on how arch. decides to implement this. Currently we only have x86
one (arch/x86/include/asm/refcount.h) and it is indeed allows increments from zero to happen. 

So, what I described above was the worst case, but since we need the code to work reliably
in each case, we have to take it into account.

No, it does not increment really, it is not just a WARN(). 
https://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/lib/refcount.c#L151
It uses refcount_inc_not_zero() underneath.

Thank you very much and sorry for the troubles!
Unfortunately none of us is free of mistakes, good that this one was caught so fast!

When it comes to value, it does provide security value for your code and makes
sure that your reference counters would not be a new target of many similar CVEs
we had in past around this. Overall each conversion matters since there is less and less
potential holes attackers can try to squeeze themselves!

Best Regards,
Elena.
