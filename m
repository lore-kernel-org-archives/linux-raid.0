I'm initializing to -1 because I know it is a value that will fail if not set later in the setup process.  I could just as easily choose the default values (near = 2).

Thanks.  For some reason I had thought that raid6 had level=5, like raid4...  Fixed.

I have seen what you do in calc_sectors(), I suppose I could bring that in.  However, I'm simply trying to find the value that will be preliminarily assigned to mddev->dev_sectors.  It is an enforced (perhaps unnecessary) constraint that the array length be divisible by the number of data devices.  I'm not accounting for chunk boundaries - I leave that to userspace to configure and MD to catch.
