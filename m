I think Milan's talking about increasing the real block size, which
would obviously require the hardware to be able to write that out
atomically, as otherwise it breaks the crypto.

But if we can instead do the IV generation within the crypto API,
then the block size won't be an issue at all.  Because you can
supply as many blocks as you want and they would be processed
block-by-block.

Now there is a disadvantage to this approach, and that is you
have to wait for the whole thing to be encrypted before you can 
start doing the IO.  I'm not sure how big a problem that is but
if it is bad enough to affect performance, we can look into adding
some form of partial completion to the crypto API.

Cheers,
