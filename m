It would be great if this function were exported, but I would
encourage everyone to consider exporting it generally, not just for
GPL usage.

The kernel seems to be pretty clean that some subsystems are GPL only
(things like sysfs), and some are open (things like the device-mapper
interfaces).  When a subsystem is part GPL and part open, it gets very
confusing for developers of commercial modules to know what to use and
what not to use.

The goal of GPL versus commercial exports should be to encourage GPL
code, not to punish commercial code by requiring stupid work arounds
that only waste time and hurt performance.

Again, most of the block IO layer is plain exports.  Adding random GPL
exports seems somewhat arbitrary.

Then again, this is your code, and If you believe it should be GPL
linkable only, then that is fine.  Just consider that there are
projects out there that are strange enough to be impacted and some
degree of symmetry is desirable.

As a side node, I would vote for longer, more descriptive names.
"__anything" should never be exported.
