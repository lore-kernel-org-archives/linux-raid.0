Well, there are two places creating queues.

Yeap, because now __make_request() filters out REQ_FLUSH bio's.

Nope, REQ_FUA will be interpreted by queues lower in the stack.
Drivers in the middle just need to pass them through.

Heh... I probably should set up a simple dm-mpath and test it.  I'll
do it this weekend.

Sure, that's a rather silly wrapper at this point.

Thanks.
