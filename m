Hi,

yes, I will try to explain current problems with cryptsetup=20
luksSuspend command and hibernation.

=46irst, sometimes it is needed to put machine into other hands.=20
You can still watch other person what is doing with machine, but=20
once if you let machine unlocked (e.g opened luks disk), she/he=20
can access encrypted data.

If you turn off machine, it could be safe, because luks disk=20
devices are locked. But if you enter machine into suspend or=20
hibernate state luks devices are still open. And my patches try=20
to achieve similar security as when machine is off (=3D no crypto=20
keys in RAM or on swap).

When doing hibernate on unencrypted swap it is to prevent leaking=20
crypto keys to hibernate image (which is stored in swap).

When doing suspend action it is again to prevent leaking crypto=20
keys. E.g when you suspend laptop and put it off (somebody can=20
remove RAMs and do some cold boot attack).

The most common situation is:
You have mounted partition from dm-crypt device (e.g. /home/),=20
some userspace processes access it (e.g opened firefox which=20
still reads/writes to cache ~/.firefox/) and you want to drop=20
crypto keys from kernel for some time.

=46or that operation there is command cryptsetup luksSuspend, which=20
suspend dm device and then tell kernel to wipe crypto keys. All=20
I/O operations are then stopped and userspace processes which=20
want to do some those I/O operations are stopped too (until you=20
call cryptsetup luksResume and enter correct key).

Now if you want to suspend/hiberate your machine (when some of dm=20
devices are suspeneded and some processes are stopped due to=20
pending I/O) it is not possible. Kernel freeze_processes function=20
will fail because userspace processes are still stopped inside=20
some I/O syscall (read/write, etc,...).

My patches fixes this problem and do those operations (suspend dm=20
device, wipe crypto keys, enter suspend/hiberate) in correct=20
order and without race condition.

dm device is suspended *after* userspace processes are freezed=20
and after that are crypto keys wiped. And then computer/laptop=20
enters into suspend/hibernate state.
