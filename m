As a DM mainatiner my only contribution to this line of discussion was
relative to your proposal to train the dm-crypt target (which is
bio-based) to also provide request-based support, see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2015-November/msg00112.html

But follow-up discussion occured, primarily with Milan Broz, which led
to this bulk mode support in the crypto layer.  Pretty strange Milan
wasn't cc'd on your patchset posting (I've now cc'd him).
