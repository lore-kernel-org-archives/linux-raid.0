Thank you.

(I don't know if some one does, but...)
Thing is: *IF* some external thing messes with
current->bio_list in "interesting" ways, and not just the
"I don't care, one level of real recursion fixes this for me"
pattern of
	struct bio_list *tmp = current->bio_list;
	current->bio_list = NULL;
	submit_bio()
	current->bio_list = tmp;
you get a chance of stack corruption,
without even as much as a compiler warning.

Which is why I wrote https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/8/469
...

Instead, I suggest to distinguish between recursive calls to
generic_make_request(), and pushing back the remainder part in
blk_queue_split(), by pointing current->bio_lists to a
	struct recursion_to_iteration_bio_lists {
		struct bio_list recursion;
		struct bio_list queue;
	}

By providing each q->make_request_fn() with an empty "recursion"
bio_list, then merging any recursively submitted bios to the
head of the "queue" list, we can make the recursion-to-iteration
logic in generic_make_request() process deepest level bios first,
and "sibling" bios of the same level in "natural" order.

...

Cheers,

	Lars
