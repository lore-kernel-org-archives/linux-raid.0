For O_DIRECT I/O REQ_NOWAIT not just about non-blocking submition.
It also provides instant feedback about contention. Like ECN from network.
This feedback is useful for rate-control and balancing load between replicas.

If upper layer simply remaps and forwards requests below then to forward
contention all layers of stacked device should support this feature.
That's why I've put it as flag into limits - to reuse limits stacking.

If any layer defers request, then it should somehow limit size of backlog
at the same time to provide sane behaviour for REQ_NOWAIT regardless of
behaviour lower devices. So, then it could simply set that flag in limits.

Also I want to add handing into blk-qos/throttler - never delay REQ_NOWAIT.
