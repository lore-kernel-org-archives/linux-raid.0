Hi Jon,
 thanks for the patch.  It looks simple and can clearly fix a problem
so at this point in the cycle I propose to submit it to Linus as-is, even
though I'm not convinced it is perfect, and you didn't give me a s-o-b line.
See more blow.

Because md_stop_writes shouldn't really be called until all incoming write
requests have completed.  md_stop_write is really meant to make sure that
write initiated by md itself have stopped.

However since the recent change to the reboot notifier, md does sometimes
call it while there could be outstanding writes.  In this case it set
safe_mode to 2 which ensures that the timer is never re-activated.

Maybe that is the "right" fix - set safe_mode to 2 inside md_stop_writes.

If you want to stop normal IO, you should either just stop sending IO
requests, or call mddev_suspend which causes all new IO to be queued.

With md, md_stop is not allowed to be called until all normal IO is
complete.  It then calls md_stop_writes to stop md initiated IO.

So md needs the del_timer_sync in md_stop_writes because it never calls
mddev_suspend (except when changing levels).  dm needs it to be in
mddev_suspend as well which is fine for now, but maybe we can clean up bit
for 3.5.

<pet peeve>.
No Signed-off-by: line?  why is that.

"Signed-off-by" *only* means "I certify that I have any necessary right to
submit this patch, and I agree to it being used in the way that all other
code in this project can be used" - only with more words.  See the Develope=
r's
Certificate of Origin 1.1

Refusing to add a Signed-off-by: because you don't think the code is "ready"
yet in some sense is just plain wrong.  I never ever want to even see a pat=
ch
that doesn't have Signed-off-by, because I don't know if I've been given
permission to use it.

Certainly add an 'RFC-by' if you want to say something about the quality of
the patch, but don't for that reason exclude the signed-off-by

Thanks,
