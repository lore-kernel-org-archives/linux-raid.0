For the md side, you can just assemble the drives into an array with
a different name.
e.g.
  mdadm -A /dev/md1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sd....

using whatever new names were given to the devices when you plugged them
back in.
Maybe you can do a similar thing with the LVM side, but I know nothing
about that.
