Does the following match with your thinking?  I'm trying to make for a more
concrete understanding...

 - We change the ->make_request_fn interface so that it takes a list of
   bios rather than a single bio - linked on ->bi_next.
   These bios must all have the same ->bi_bdev.  They *might* be sorted
   by bi_sector (that needs to be decided).


 - generic_make_request currently queues bios if there is already an active
   request (this limits recursion).  We enhance this to also queue requests
   when code calls blk_start_plug.
   In effect, generic_make_request becomes:
        if (current->plug)
		blk_add_to_plug(current->plug, bio);
	else {
		struct blk_plug plug;
		blk_start_plug(&plug);
		__generic_make_request(bio);
		blk_finish_plug(&plug);
	}

 - __generic_make_request would sort the list of bios by bi_bdev (and maybe 
   bi_sector) and pass them along to the different ->make_request_fn
   functions.

   As there are likely to be only a few different bi_bdev values (often 1) but
   hopefully lots and lots of bios it might be more efficient to do a linear
   bucket sort based on bi_bdev, and only sort those buckets on bi_sector if
   required.

Then make_request_fn handlers can expect to get lots of bios at once, can
optimise their handling as seems appropriate, and not require any further
plugging.


Is that at all close to what you are thinking?
