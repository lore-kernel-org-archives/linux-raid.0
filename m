I have another report of that BUG - from Fengguang Wu.  I suspect it and
you're other BUG are related.

Excellent.  It means we are on the right track at least.

If a stripe is on the released_stripes list (and has STRIPE_ON_RELEASE_LIST)
set, it means that a call to __release_stripe is pending, so the ->count mu=
st
be at least 1.
So we would need some other actor to be holding device_lock, incrementing
->count, and  then placing the stripe on the released_stripes list.  I don't
think that is possible.

I think I see the race now though (don't know why I couldn't see it
yesterday .. but knowing it must be there from your testing must have
helped).

I think the race is with __get_priority_stripe().  That is the  only place
other than get_active_stripe() where we can increment ->count from zero.
So:
  1-1: get_active_stripe() sees ->count is zero
  1-2: tried to get device_lock and blocks
  2-1: meanwhile handle_active_stripes is holding ->device_lock and
       chooses this stripe from handle list.  It deletes it from the
       ->lru and increments the count - then releases ->device_lock
  1-3: get_active_stripe() sees that ->lru is empty, and complains.

You other BUG is triggered by a difference race caused by the same locking
problem.

->active_stripes counts the number of stripes which have a non-zero ->count,
or have STRIPE_HANDLE set.  STRIPE_HANDLE can only be set when ->count is
non-zero, so we just need to update this whenever count reaches zero or
leaves zero while STRIPE_HANDLE is set.
This would previously always happen under device_lock.  However
get_active_stripe() now increments ->count from zero under ->hash_locks.
This could  race with __release_stripe() which only needs device_lock
So=20
  1-1: get_active_stripe notices that ->count is not zero and skips locking
       with device_lock
  2-1: __release_stripe() decrements ->count to zero and calls
      do_release_stripe which, as STRIPE_HANDLE is not set, decrements
      ->active_stripes
  1-1: get_active_stripe proceeds to increment ->count from zero without a
       matching increment for ->active_stripes

so now ->active_stripes is 1 too small and your BUG is not far away.


So I think we do need to extend the lock region exactly as in the patch you
tried.
Sad thing is that Shaohua originally had the code like that but I talked him
out of it. :-(
http://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg44290.html

It seems a shame to be taking device_lock here rather than just hash_locks.
It might be possible to relax that a bit, but first we would need to measure
if it was worth it.

This is the patch I'm thinking of for now.  It also fixes up the two BUGs as
both of them are wrong.
STRIPE_ON_RELEASE_LIST has no effect on the value of ->lru, so it shouldn't
be included.  And while STRIPE_EXPANDING justifies an active stripe_head
being on an lru, it is never ever set for an inactive stripe_head (which is
always on an lru) so it shouldn't be there either.

Does that all sound convincing?

Thanks a lot,
NeilBrown
