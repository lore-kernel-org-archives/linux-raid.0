Sorry, I mean 'checks', not 'changes'.

I was confused a bit by the code.  It might be clearer to have

   sectors_per_dev =3D ti->len * rs->md.raid_disks;
   remainder =3D sector_div(sectors_per_dev, raid10_copies);

In almost all cases raid10_copies will be 2 and ti->len will be a multiple =
of
8 (as we don't support chunk sizes less than 4K), so remainder will be 0.
However this doesn't really prove anything.  It is still entirely possible
that the resulting 'sectors_per_dev' will not result in a RAID10 which has
the full ti->len sectors required.
So your test is not sufficient.

Also your calculation is incorrect as it doesn't allow for the possibility =
of
unused space in the array.
A 3-drive 2-copy RAID10 with an odd number of chunks will not use the last
chunk on the last device. In that case the above calculation will result in
a sectors_per_dev that it too small.

I think your sectors_per_dev calculation should round up to a whole number =
of
chunks.

   sectors_per_dev =3D DIV_ROUND_UP_SECTOR_T(ti->len * rs->md.raid_disks,
                                           raid10_copies);
   sectors_per_dev =3D round_up(sectors_per_dev, rs->md.chunk_sectors);

And then after calling md_run(), you should check that
 pers->size(mddev, 0, 0) =3D=3D ti->len
and abort if not.

Note that getting the sectors_per_dev right is really really important for
RAID10-far.  For other layouts and levels a smaller sectors_per_dev will ju=
st
result in less data being available.
For raid10-far, sectors_per_dev is included in the layout calculations so
changing it will change the location of data and could result in corruption.
