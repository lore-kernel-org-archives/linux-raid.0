That would be the exactly how I understand Documentation/block/barrier.txt:

"In other words, I/O barrier requests have the following two properties.
1. Request ordering
...
2. Forced flushing to physical medium"

"So, I/O barriers need to guarantee that requests actually get written
to non-volatile medium in order."
