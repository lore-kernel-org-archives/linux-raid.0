I'm not a developer by any stretch of the word so take what I say with
a grain of salt.

I think it's more just a case of dm using md's RAID algorithms, which
IMHO are better tested, to support fakeraid controllers like Intel's
Matrix RAID. Besides, we're all one big happy linux family so why not
borrow your brother's socks? :-)
