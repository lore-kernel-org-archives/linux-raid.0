It's still their own implementation of poor quality.  That it is poor
quality shows in the numbers, which are dramatically lower than the
actual Linux implementation -- by an order of magnitude or more.  In
other words, they build a strawman and knock it down.

The actual Linux implementation blasts any of the numbers they have in
their paper, which I presume means they haven't optimized any of them.
As such, all the numbers are meaningless.
