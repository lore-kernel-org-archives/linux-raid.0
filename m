Yes, agreed.  My point was that if we have a better system, we could
migrate blkid and other users to new interface, and maybe in a few
years, we can deprecate that interface.  So we do have to maintain
them for at least the medium term, but that shouldn't stop us from
divising a better interface, and then gradually migrating systems to
use that newer and better interface.
