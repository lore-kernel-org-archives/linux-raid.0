The academic in me says we should push that error handling into
generic_make_request() or some raid function in md.c that deals with
those problems. Sounds like there's a fair bit of duplicate
functionality that could be re-factored out.

Doesn't help when there's not an architect to design an overall "grand
scheme", but my usual way of working is to design top down academically,
and then ask myself "what do I need" before implementing bottom-up.
Hopefully with a load of documentation saying "I haven't done this
because I don't need it, but this is where it goes".

Cheers,
