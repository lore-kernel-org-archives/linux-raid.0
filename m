Yes, that looks nice.  Plus, it doesn't have as many conditions as my idea.

We then need to replace 'd += geo->near_copies' with 'd += geo->dev_stride' and set dev_stride in 'setup_geo'.  I'm not certain how much work it is beyond that, but I don't *think* it looks that bad and I'd be happy to do it.

ok.  Might come after my current dm-raid patch (that will skip over the current "far" implementations.

If the 17th bit makes it simple to change the 'far' algorithms, that's probably the right idea.  We could save the very last bits for when we need a completely changed view of how the variable is used.  I don't think we are there yet.
