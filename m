TBH, I don't give a crap about tools. They invented something that might
or might not follow kernel APIs. At the end, it's a user space.

Propose a patch then. Perhaps I need to inform tools people about new
API coming, but that's all what I can do. Existing something in tools/
does not and should not prevent extending / changing kernel internal
APIs.

What about it? It's not in scope of this API for sure. The above
mentioned functions have a very limited area of usage.
Your example also a bit complicated, since it's not allocating _just_ a
bitmap, but a structure _with_ embedded bitmap.

There is no such file in the tree. You perhaps referred to
drivers/dma/ti/edma.c.

Yes, this is a candidate to convert later on if anyone wants to do it
(with introducing devm_bitmap_alloc() / devm_bitmap_zalloc() helpers).

So, I prefer one step at a time. Especially taking into consideration
the problems I have to solve now with those simplest helpers I proposed.
