12 disks maximum (you have 8 with data, the rest are mirrors, parity, or
mirrors of parity).

> RAID 16 = 12 disk redundancy

14 disks maximum (you have 6 with data, the rest are mirrors, parity, or
mirrors of parity).

Yes, I know these are the minimum redundancies.  But that's a vital
figure for reliability (even if the range is important for statistical
averages).  When one disk in a raid10 array fails, your main concern is
about failures or URE's in the other half of the pair - it doesn't help
to know that another nine disks can "safely" fail too.
