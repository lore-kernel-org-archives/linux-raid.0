Hi Eric,
=A0=A0=A0 This is PowerPC architecture from AMCC(I work for AMCC). I am=
 using 2.6.25 Kernel. According your suggestion I tested with out RAID =
I did not see any EXT-3 errors. I use "sum" command to check the data i=
ntegrity of the files.=20
I ported ADMA driver to do HW accelerated XOR calculations . Also pleas=
e note that RAID-5 works with 4K Page size.
Thanks,
Marri

Do you think it is specific to the filesystem on raid-5?=A0 Have you te=
sted
w/o md?=A0 I'd be a little surprised if the problem is at the raid laye=
r (so
cc'ing the ext3/4 list), but maybe you tested that already.

Which arch is it, and which kernel?=A0 How big is the filesystem?=A0 Wi=
th full
geometry information it might be easier for someone to reproduce & debu=
g.

Thanks,
