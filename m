Thanks for clarifying these conversions, I was presuming there were
atomicity issues in the md kernel code to conform to.

Canges to run those sequences look straightforward in the dm-raid target.
I'll implement them and test.

You got a point with regards to the dm-raid target:
if an MD takeover API is actually superfluous in the end, the target
won't have 2 code paths for

a) going from a non-metadata config to a metadata one (e.g. striped -> 
raid5)

and

b) a metadata -> metadata one (e.g. raid6 -> raid5)


In lvm2/dm userspace there will be no difference, because it has to
update the userspace metadata and the kernel metadata comiting it
in the proper sequence and does not call any takeover api in userspace
at all which could be avoided as in the kernel.

Agreed, we need more facts.

I've seen indications from "dd oflag=direct iflag=fullblock bs=1G 
count=1 if=/dev/zero of=$LV
converting back and forth to/from raid0/striped mappings on an otherwise 
idle system.

Ok, let me do avoiding patches based on your clarifications
which'll take till next week including testing.

Sure.
I'd like to see the raid0 conditonal request queue patch though.
