Hi Neil, sorry for my delay.

Yes, I did. After writing, I ran both "sync" and "sync -f" after "dd"
command complete (with no errors). The sync procedures also finished
without errors, and the file was there. After a reboot, though, the
file has a different md5, since it was corrupted.

The problem with the time between userspace notice something is wrong
and "warn" the kernel to stop writes is that many writes will be sent
to the device in this mean time, and they can completed later - handling
async completions of dead devices proved to be tricky, at least in my
approach.
Also, writeback threads will be filled with I/Os to be written to the
dead devices too, this is other part of the problem.

If you have suggestions to improve my approach, or perhaps a totally
different idea than mine, I highly appreciate the feedback.

Thank you very much for the attention.
Cheers,


Guilherme
