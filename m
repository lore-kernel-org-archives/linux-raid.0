Users can supply as little as one long word worth of data (codes_size =
maxlen = 4). You really do not want the rest of the mask you will be
applying to contain random heap garbage.

I'm afraid you suspect wrong, as (unfortunately, but it is ABI now) we
are not dealing with masks consisting of u32 or u64 elements, but
"unsigned long" elements, which change size depending on 32/64 bit
architecture and whether we are dealing with compat or native userspace.

It also needs both maxbit and maxlen, because one is kernel's limit
while the other is limit from userspace POV and you need to reconcile
both to make sure you do not overrun buffers on either side.

Thanks.
