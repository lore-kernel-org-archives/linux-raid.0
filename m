Do you think it is specific to the filesystem on raid-5?  Have you test=
ed
w/o md?  I'd be a little surprised if the problem is at the raid layer =
(so
cc'ing the ext3/4 list), but maybe you tested that already.

Which arch is it, and which kernel?  How big is the filesystem?  With f=
ull
geometry information it might be easier for someone to reproduce & debu=
g.

Thanks,
