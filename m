The multiple instances issue in /proc/crypto is fixed. It was because of
the IV code itself modifying the algorithm name inadvertently in the
global crypto algorithm lookup table when it was splitting up
"plain(cbc(aes))" into "plain" and "cbc(aes)" so as to invoke the child
algorithm.

I ran a few tests with dd, bonnie and FIO under Qemu - x86 using the
automated script [1] that I wrote to make the testing easy.
The tests were done on software implementations of the algorithms
as the real hardware was not available with me. According to the test,
I found that the sequential reads and writes have a good improvement
(5.7 %) in the data rate with the proposed solution while the random
reads shows a very little improvement. When tested with FIO, the
random writes also shows a small improvement (2.2%) but the random
reads show a little deterioration in performance (4 %).

When tested in arm hardware, only the sequential writes with bonnie
shows improvement (5.6%). All other tests shows degraded performance
in the absence of crypto hardware.
