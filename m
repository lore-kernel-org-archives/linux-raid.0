Yeah, Now many vendors will supply AES hardware engine to improve the
encryption speed. Like Qualcom or Spreadtrum, they both support the
AES engine, which can handle the IV things in engine interior. So it
can handle bulk data with just one initial IV, which is implemented in
the out of tree req-dm-crypt code. That is why Milan's testing is
failed, cause there is no hardware engine to support this.
