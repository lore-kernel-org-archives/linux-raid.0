I don't think we really can change anything here, there are more users =
of it.

If we would go changing things here, the file names should never be
the device name but the format "b8:32" for blockdevs, "n22" for the
network ifindex, ... which is the unchangeable unique kernel id -- not
depending on any possible device rename, or fast destroy/re-create or
anything like that.
