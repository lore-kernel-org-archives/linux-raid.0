I really like this change.  It seems to precisely address the problem.
The "problem" being that requests for "this" device are potentially
mixed up with requests from underlying devices.
However I'm not sure it is quite general enough.

The "remainder" list is a stack of requests aimed at "this" level or
higher, and I think it will always exactly fit that description.
The "recursion" list needs to be a queue of requests aimed at the next
level down, and that doesn't quiet work, because once you start acting
on the first entry in that list, all the rest become "this" level.

I think you can address this by always calling ->make_request_fn with an
empty "recursion", then after the call completes, splice the "recursion"
list that resulted (if any) on top of the "remainder" stack.

This way, the "remainder" stack is always "requests for lower-level
devices before request for upper level devices" and the "recursion"
queue is always "requests for devices below the current level".

I also really *don't* like the idea of punting to a separate thread - it
seems to be just delaying the problem.

Can you try move the bio_list_init(->recursion) call to just before
the ->make_request_fn() call, and adding
    bio_list_merge_head(->remainder, ->recursion)
just after?
(or something like that) and confirm it makes sense, and works?

Thanks!
