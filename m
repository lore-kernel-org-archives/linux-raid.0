Chrome OS uses coreboot as its boot firmware and a coreboot module
known as "depthcharge" for doing the crypto-verification and booting
of the Chrome OS system. This is the static root of trust Chrome OS
extends from its read-only boot firmware through to the kernel it
loads and the dm-verity partition it mounts as the read-only root
filesystem. To keep the boot speed fast and the kernel size small,
there is no initramfs.

I didn't say it was hugely inefficient, but for Chrome OS it's not
needed, and was a measurable source of boot time. We just got rid of
it since it was redundant. I can't change that design decision; I'm
just here to help bring the dm= boot support upstream. :)

Yeah, I'm open to whatever suggestions you have.

Seems like it shouldn't be too bad.

Chrome OS is hardly the only Linux device without an initramfs, but
yeah, it does cause us headaches from time to time.
