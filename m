Currently you can go for hours without ever reaching a clean state on 
active files. By not deliberately allowing the buffer to change during a 
write the chances for getting consistent data on the disk should be 
significantly improved.

The point I was making is that after you change the code I would still 
want that to happen. And your comment above seems to indicate a goal of 
getting consistent data after a crash, with less concern that it be the 
most recent data written. Sorry in advance if that's a misreading of 
"you just must not forget to resync them after a crash."

--- this is the simplest fix. If the computer crashes after a long time, it
resynchronizes the whole device. But there won't cause application-visible

3. turn off the region bit if the region wasn't written in one pdflush
period --- requires an interaction with pdflush, rather complex. The problem
here is that pdflush makes its best effort to write data in
dirty_writeback_centisecs interval, but it is not guaranteed to do it.

4. make more region states: Region has in-memory states CLEAN, DIRTY,
MAYBE_DIRTY, CLEAN_CANDIDATE.

When you start writing to the region, it is always moved to DIRTY state (and
on-disk bit is turned on).

When you finish all writes to the region, move it to MAYBE_DIRTY state, but
leave bit on disk on. We now don't know if the region is dirty or no.

Run a helper thread that does periodically:
Change MAYBE_DIRTY regions to CLEAN_CANDIDATE
Issue sync()
Change CLEAN_CANDIDATE regions to CLEAN state and clear their on-disk bit.

The rationale is that if the above write-while-modify scenario happens, the
page is always dirty. Thus, sync() will write the page, kick the region back
from CLEAN_CANDIDATE to MAYBE_DIRTY state and we won't mark the region as
clean on disk.


I'd like to know you ideas on this, before we start coding a solution.

Copying the data would be performance overkill. You can really write 
different data to different disks, you just must not forget to resync them 
after a crash. The filesystem/application will recover with either old or 
new data --- it just won't recover when it's reading old and new data from 
the same location.
