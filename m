Hi Neil,

Thanks for fixing this DM on MD flush issue.  But my attempts to
reproduce it have been unsuccessful.

I've tried ext4 w/ barriers to a DM device above a 2 member MD RAID1.
The DM device has a table with 2 linear targets to the same md0
device:

# dmsetup table
multiple_targets: 0 24576 linear 9:0 2048
multiple_targets: 24576 49152 linear 9:0 26624

No amount of IO with flushes has enabled me to hit a deadlock (in
md_flush_request,  md_write_start, etc).

Do you have a simple reproducer for this issue?

Mike
