This argument doesn't make much sense to me.

There is no reason that the assembling the array in a new configuration wou=
ld
fail, except possible malloc error or similar which would make putting it
back into the original configuration fail as well.

There is no need to synchronise updating the metadata with a take-over.
In every case, the "Before" and "After" configurations are functionally
identical.
A 2-drive RAID1 behaves identically to a 2-drive RAID5, for example.
So it doesn't really matter whether or not the metadata match how the kernel
is configured.  Once you start a reshape (e.g. 2-drive RAID5 to 3-drive
RAID5) or add a spare, then you need the metadata to be correct, but that is
just a sequencing issue:

- start: metadata says "raid1".
- suspend array, reconfigure as RAID5 with 2 drives, resume.
- if everything went well, update metadata to "raid5".
- now update metadata to "0 block of progress into reshape from 2-drives to
  3-drives".
- now start the reshape, which will further update the metadata as it
  proceeds.

There really are no atomicity requirements, only sequencing.

Given that you plan to do this, I really think the dm and LVM code would be
simpler if all reconfigurations use this same approach.

That is surprising.  I would be great if we could characterise  what sort of
workloads work better with one or the other...

I have exactly the same issue with md_resize() as with md_takeover(), and f=
or
the same reasons.

How about we wait until you do implement the
 suspend/dismantle/reassemble/resume
approach, and see if you still want md_resize/md_takeover after that?

Thanks,
