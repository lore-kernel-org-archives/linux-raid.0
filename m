Now the dm-crypt code only implemented the 'based-bio' method to encrypt/
decrypt block data, which can only hanle one bio at one time. As we know,
one bio must use the sequential physical address and it also has a limitation
of length. Thus it may limit the big block encyrtion/decryption when some
hardware support the big block data encryption.

This patch series introduc the 'based-request' method to handle the data
encryption/decryption. One request can contain multiple bios, so it can
handle big block data to improve the efficiency.

Also this patch refers to the Dinesh K Garg <dineshg@codeaurora.org> and
franciscofranco <franciscofranco.1990@gmail.com> submission of 'Request
based dm-crypt', and the original link is:
https://github.com/major91/Zeta-Chromium-N5/commit/621d4821da04cfde383329ebdf4ce8711ec3329c

Now it can encrypt/decrypt successfully with read/write testing, and it shows
some efficiency improvements with hardware acceleration. But I really hope to
need more comments about the structure and conception. Thanks for your review.
