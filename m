DM RAID:  Add message/status support for changing sync action

This patch adds a message interface to dm-raid to allow the user to more
finely control the sync actions being performed by the MD driver.  This
gives the user the ability to initiate "check" and "repair" (i.e. scrubbing).
Two additional fields have been added to the status output to provide more
information about the type of sync action occurring and the results of those
actions, specifically: <sync_action> and <mismatch_cnt>.  This is essentially
the device-mapper way of doing what MD controls through the 'sync_action'
sysfs file and shows through the 'mismatch_cnt' sysfs file.

This is a first patch and I still have two concerns:
1) in 'raid_messages', reap_sync_thread() is not called when "frozen" or
   "idle" is issued like it would be in  md.c:action_store() because it is
   not available to dm-raid.c.  This hasn't prevented the thread from
   shutting down properly in my tests, but there may be something I'm
   not considering.
2) (and this is more of an LVM problem)  The "in-sync ratio" field of the
   status output has generally been used to determine the progress of the
   initial synchronization or of rebuilding a device.  "check" and "repair"
   have not been available options until now.  So, if this ratio also
   shows the progress of a "check", older versions of LVM would seem to
   indicate (through the 'sync%' field) that the array is not in-sync, when
   in fact it is.  Thus, this change might be perceived as a break to
   backwards compatability.  (However, the old LVM tools would not be able
   to /issue/ a "check" command and should never run into this.)  I don't
   see this as a problem for this patch, but I thought it should be
   brought up and considered.   Obviously, code in LVM will need to be
   changed to adjust to this - perhaps to show the different types of sync
   actions that might be occurring.

+	<raid_type>     Same as the <raid_type> used to create the array.
+	<health_chars>  One char for each device, indicating: 'A' = alive and
+			in-sync, 'a' = alive but not in-sync, 'D' = dead/failed.
+	<resync_ratio>  The ratio indicating how much of the array is know to be
+			in-sync.  This ratio only applies to an array undergoing
+			its initialization or recovery.
+	<sync_action>   One of the following possible states:
+			idle    - No synchronization action is being performed.
+			frozen  - The current action has been halted.
+			resync  - Array is undergoing its initial synchronization
+				  or is resynchronizing after an unclean shutdown
+				  (possibly aided by a bitmap).
+			recover - A device in the array is being rebuilt or
+				  replaced.
+			check   - A user-initiated full check of the array is
+				  being performed.  All blocks are read and
+				  checked for consistency.  The number of
+				  discrepancies found are recorded in
+				  <mismatch_cnt>.  No changes are made to the
+				  array by this action.
+			repair  - The same as "check", but discrepancies are
+				  corrected.
+			reshape - The array is undergoing a reshape.
+	<mismatch_cnt>  The number of discrepancies found between mirror copies
+			in RAID1/10 or wrong parity values found in RAID4/5/6.
+			This value is valid only after a "check" of the array
+			is performed.  A healthy array has a 'mismatch_cnt' of 0.

+Message Interface
+-----------------
+The dm-raid target will accept certain actions through the 'message' interface.

+	"check"  - Initiate a check (i.e. a "scrub") of the array.
+	"repair" - Initiate a repair of the array.
