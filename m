Not really. A single 8x PCIe 2.0 card has 8 x 500MB/s = 4000MB/s of
potential bandwidth. That would be 250MB/s per drive for 16 drives.

But quite a few people running software RAID with many drives have
multiple PCIe cards. For example, in one machine I have three IBM
M1015 cards (which I got for $75/ea) that are 8x PCIe 2.0. That comes
to 3 x 500MB/s x 8 = 12GB/s of IO bandwidth.

Also, your math is wrong. PCIe 3.0 is 985 MB/s per lane. If we assume
PCIe 4.0 would double that, we would have 1970MB/s per lane. So one
lane of the hypothetical PCIe 4.0 would have enough IO bandwidth to
give about 120MB/s to each of 16 drives. A single 8x PCIe 4.0 card
would have 8 times that capability which is more than 15GB/s.

Even a single 8x PCIe 3.0 card has potentially over 7GB/s of bandwidth.

Bottom line is that IO bandwidth is not a problem for a system with
prudently chosen hardware.

More likely is that you would be CPU limited (rather than bus limited)
in a high-parity rebuild where more than one drive failed. But even
that is not likely to be too bad, since Andrea's single-threaded
recovery code can recover two drives at nearly 1GB/s on one of my
machines. I think the code could probably be threaded to achieve a
multiple of that running on multiple cores.
