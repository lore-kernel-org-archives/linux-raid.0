This is just great Andrea,
thank you for such Epiphany present.

Just by looking at the Subjects, it seems patch number 0/1 is missing. 
It might have not gotten through to the lists, or be a numbering mistake.

Does your code also support (shortcut) RMW as opposed to RCW, for all 
parities?
RMW is: for a 4k write: read just nparities+1data disks, recompute 
parities, write nparities+1data disks,
RCW is: "read all disks" prior to recompute parities...

Part of such RMW code should be in handle_stripe_dirtying which is not 
in your patch 0/2 but that might have been in patch 0/1 which apparently 
didn't get through.

See this patch by Kumar for support of RMW in raid6 (raid5 has it) which 
unfortunately apparently wasn't merged up to now:

Thank you
J.
