Sorry was traveling.

Yes I have an old fix for this. Which I need to cleanup and retest.
My original problem was an hang in UML, but I noticed the timing problems
as well.

Please give me til the end of the week to settle in and come up to speed.

[Current patch: http://marc.info/?l=linux-crypto-vger&m=131829242311458&w=2]

Thanks
Boaz
