Hi Arthur,
 thanks for all your IMSM work over the years!  It is great that you can
 continue contributing and do so more broadly.

 For the moment Jes Serensen will be co-ordinating mdadm (once I make a
 release ... tomorrow?) and Shaohua Li will be looking after the
 kernel/md side.  I'm sure there is plenty of room for you too though.
 Only one person (at a time) can queue patches, but several can
 collaborate at development and support and bug fixing and testing and
 ....
 I suggest you find ways to co-ordinate with them.

 This:
     https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108741
 is currently most important in my mind, but there are other things to
 do.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
