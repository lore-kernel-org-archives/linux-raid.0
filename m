Or +200MB/s is enough for a lot of people :)

What is really strange is that from all the tests I did the raw md perf=
s never
dropped. only a few MB of diff between kernel (~2%). This is maybe rela=
ted to
the way upper FS write datas on the md layer.

I'll make the tests on raw disks to see if there is some troubles here =
also. I
can also test with other raid layers. Is there any tuning/debug I
can make for you ? I can also setup a remote access to this system if n=
eeded.

Thanks.
