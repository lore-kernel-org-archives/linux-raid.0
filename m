The code path that I'm changing is only executed when ext4_sync_file determines
that the flush can't go through the journal, i.e. whenever the previous
sequence of data writes hasn't resulted in any metadata updates, or if the
transaction that went with the previous writes has already been committed.

The mount option is no longer the delay time, as it was in previous patches.
In the (unreleased) v5 patch, the code automatically tuned the delay based on
the average flush time.  However, we then observed very low flush times (< 2ms)
and about a 6% regression on our arrays with battery-backed write cache, so the
auto-tune code was then adapted in v6 to skip the coordination if the average
flush time falls below that threshold, as it does on our arrays.

Therefore, the new mount option exists to override the default threshold.
