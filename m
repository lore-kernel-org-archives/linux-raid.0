Nah, that would be minor hacking.  Just recreate the RAID1 in a state that =
is
not-insync, but with automatic-resync disabled.
Then as continuous writes arrive, move the "recovery_cp" variable forward
towards the end of the array.  When it reaches the end we can safely mark t=
he
whole array as 'in-sync' and forget about diabling auto-resync.
