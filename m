               *** Announcement: dmraid 1.0.0.rc7 ***

dmraid 1.0.0.rc7 is available at
http://people.redhat.com:/heinzm/sw/dmraid/ in source tarball,
source rpm and i386 rpms (shared, static and dietlibc).

This release fixes size bugs with Highpoint and Promise RAID1 sets.

dmraid (Device-Mapper Raid tool) discovers, [de]activates and displays
properties of software RAID sets (i.e. ATARAID) and contained DOS
partitions using the device-mapper runtime of the 2.6 kernel.

The following ATARAID types are supported on Linux 2.6:

Highpoint HPT37X
Highpoint HPT45X
Intel Software RAID
LSI Logic MegaRAID
NVidia NForce
Promise FastTrack
Silicon Image Medley
VIA Software RAID

Please provide insight to support those metadata formats completely.

Thanks.


See files README and CHANGELOG, which come with the source tarball for
prerequisites to run this software, further instructions on installing
and using dmraid!

CHANGELOG is contained below for your convenience as well.


Call for testers:
-----------------

I need testers with the above ATARAID types, to check that the mapping
created by this tool is correct (see options "-t -ay") and access to the
ATARAID data is proper.

In case you have a different ATARAID solution from those listed above,
please feel free to contact me about supporting it in dmraid.

You can activate your ATARAID sets without danger of overwriting
your metadata, because dmraid accesses it read-only unless you use
option -E together with -r in order to erase ATARAID metadata
(see 'man dmraid')!

This is a release candidate version so you want to have backups of your valuable
data *and* you want to test accessing your data read-only first in order to
make sure that the mapping is correct before you go for read-write access.
