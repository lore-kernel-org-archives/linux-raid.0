Hi, I understand your concern. But all other raid levels contains 
failure-event mechanisms. For example, in all my tests with raid5 or 
raid1, it first complained the device was removed, then it failed in 
super_written() when no other available device was present.
On the other hand, raid0 does "blind-writes": it just selects the device 
in which that bio should be written (given the stripe math) and change 
the bio's device, sending it back via generic_make_request(). It's 
dummy, but not in a bad way, but rather for performance reasons. It has 
no "intelligence" for failures, as all other raid levels.

That said, we could fix md.c for all raid levels, but I personally think 
it's a bazooka shot, only raid0 shows consistently this issue.

Heheh you have good points here! Thanks for the input =)
