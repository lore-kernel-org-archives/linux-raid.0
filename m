Hi Roman, I don't think this is usual setup. I understand that there are
RAID10 (also known as RAID 0+1) in which we can have like 4 devices, and
they pair in 2 sets of two disks using stripping, then these sets are
paired using mirroring. This is handled by raid10 driver however, so it
won't suffer for this issue.

I don't think it's common or even makes sense to back a raid1 with 2
pure raid0 devices.
Thanks for your comment!
Cheers,


Guilherme
