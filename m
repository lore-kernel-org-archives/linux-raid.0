But would it actually make any difference?  It's not like the usual
completion path in the optimized case is much longer.  It will set all
the skip bits, try to determine the next step which is completion and
then complete the flush request.  It'll sure occupy the CPU for a
little bit longer but I don't think it will be anything measureable.
Is there a workload that this can actually help?

Thanks.
