It didn't imply we need large sector sizes, but the same mechanism
to expodse a large sector size can also be used to present large
stripe units/width.

Seems like 233 should have cought it regularly with the explicit
alignment options on mkfs time.  Maybe we also need a test mirroring
the plain dd more closely?

I've not seen 233 fail for a long time..
