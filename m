I realize that, in fact it's already safe as long as you pass in 'true'
for __blk_run_queue(). Before I had rewritten it to move the running
out, so that makes the trick a little difficult. This afternoon I also
tested it and saw no noticable difference, but I'll probably just do it
anyway as it makes sense.
