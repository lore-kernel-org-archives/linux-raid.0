I think it's not good to add a global counter in mddev, and I agree it's
not good to increase md_io_clone for this corner case.

How about we remove the use of bi_private filed, and replace it with
container_of() to get md_clone_io from md_end_clone_io. And then we can use
this field to record the completion without adding new field.
