Not correct.  The whole point of this exercise is to reuse md code.

Also not correct.  You can certainly have more than one failed device
providing you don't have 'n' adjacent devices all failed.
So e.g. if you have 2 drives in a far-2 layout then you can survive the
failure of three devices if they are 0,2,4 or 1,3,5.

This "flawed" arrangement is the only one that makes sense for an odd number
of devices (assuming 2 copies).
