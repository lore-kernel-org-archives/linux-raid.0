Hello,

Some of these patches were send few years back, I saw that first
version was send to this list in 2010, and after version 4 did not
land [1]. Some days ago I resend the patches [2] and few hours later I
noticed that one year ago was send a v5 version [3] and I was not aware.

There was some discussion about v5 and during the discussion Mike Snitzer
proposed that at least a change of the syntax is required, we're really
interested on see this upstream as is extensively used in ChromeOS based
devices so I'm wondering if we can restart the discussion and hopefully
we will be able to do the modifications needed.

So my first question is, apart of the change of the syntax, what more
should be changed?

Thanks for your help,
 Enric
