Ok, it's really interesting that we're only getting you 4% faster tput,
at 63% more cycles.  That looks like something more than just cache
affinity, but at least for btrfs I always had bigger problems than
affinity, so I haven't dug into that part yet.

Well, I'd definitely say the pool is going to give you a random
core.

Grin, it doesn't take many butter jokes to sell me.  Careful though, yo=
u
can't have just one buttery thread pool.  Just wait, you'll think of
good reasons to add another real soon.

Speaking of which, you want to use the atomic thread starting helper.
Basically kthread_run does GFP allocations that can wait on disk, and
if you're the disk it is waiting on things can go badly in a hurry.

We should probably integrate a single kthread run helper thread into th=
e
pools instead of forcing people to make their own.  I'll take a look.
