Hmm... I'm not seeing any differences in the block allocation code, or
in ext4's buffered writeback code paths, which would be the most
likely cause of such problems.  Maybe a quick eyeball of the blktrace
to see if we're doing something pathalogically stupid?

You could also try running a filefrag -v on a few of the dd files to
see if there's any significant difference, although as I said, there
doesn't look like there was any significant changes in the block
allocation code between v3.5 and v3.6-rc1 --- although I suppose
changes in timeing could have have caused the block allocation
decisions to be different, so it's worth checking that out.

Thanks, regards,
