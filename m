Hi Arthur,

I have setup a git repository for mdadm here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git

I'll be relying heavily on your contributions in managing this now that
Neil is leaving it to us. I'll do my best to maintain it in a similar
manner to Neil, albeit I am probably going to screw up a lot more often.

Please fire away those patches and do not be afraid to yell at me if I
get something wrong!

Cheers,
Jes
