Well, if clang (or C99 code) is now preferred for kernel, why not.

Just please commit the patch series en bloc (together with the patches
removing VLAIS from crypto code you posted to cryptoapi list).

Dmcrypt should always use the same coding practices as crypto part of t=
he kernel
so we should not divert here.

TBH, this looks even more uglier that the previous code :-)

(But tglx already complained on different patch and I fully agree that =
crypto code
should not use this kind of construction in the first place...
It would be very nice to introduce at least some macro hiding these cra=
zy
stack allocations later.)

Thanks,
