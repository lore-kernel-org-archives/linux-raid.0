Thank you for the review.
I will incorporate the feedback into v2.

So this one was a bit of a shocker.  I though the  _interruptible use
sites seemed
wrong in the sense of being needless. However, after reading your feedback and
reviewing the code I'm pretty sure every single one of them (including
the one I've
added in dm-verity-target.c this merge window)  are down right dangerous and
can cause random data corruption... so thanks for pointing this out!

I though of this patch set as a "make the code pretty" for 4.13 kind
of patch set.
Looks like it's a bug fix now, maybe even stable material.

Anyway, I'll roll a v2 and we'll see.

Thanks,
Gilad
