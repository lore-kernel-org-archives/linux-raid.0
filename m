Taking a look at do_xor_speed, I see two issues which might be the cause
of the disparity you reported.

0) In the RAID5 xor benchmark, we get the current jiffy, then run do_2() until
the jiffy increments. This means we could potentially be testing for less
than a full jiffy. The RAID6 benchmark handles this by obtaining the current
jiffy, then calling cpu_relax() until the jiffy increments, and then running
the test. This is addressed by my first patch.

1) The only way I could reproduce your findings of a higher throughput for
RAID6 than for RAID5 xor checksumming was with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y. It seems
that you encountered this while running as XEN dom0. Currently, we disable
preemption during the RAID6 benchmark, but don't in the RAID5 benchmark. 
This is addressed by my second patch.

I've added linux-crypto to the discussion as both of these patches affect
code in crypto/

Thanks.
