I can give it a shot.  The easiest way to test would be to export your
versions via a struct xor_block_template.  However, the question I
have is how do your macros differ from the existing ones in
include/asm-generic/xor.h?  Can we achieve the same effect by
extending the ones in include/asm-generic/xor.h to do up to 8 at a
time?

Thanks,
Dan
