If you have hard drive and some sectors or track stop working, I think
you would still expect IO to the other sectors or tracks to keep
working.

For this reason, the behaviour of md/raid0 is to continue to serve IO to
working devices, and only fail IO to failed/missing devices.

It seems reasonable that you might want a different behaviour, but I
think that should be optional.  i.e. you would need to explicitly set a
"one-out-all-out" flag on the array.  I'm not sure if this should cause
reads to fail, but it seems quite reasonable that it would cause all
writes to fail.

I would only change the kernel to recognise the flag and refuse any
writes after any error has been seen.
I would use udev/mdadm to detect a device removal and to mark the
relevant component device as missing.
