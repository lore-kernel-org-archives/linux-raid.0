Could you tell details about how the deadlock happened?

dm's end_io always throws the completion handling to softirq:
  end_clone_request()
    dm_complete_request()
      blk_complete_request()

then it is processed in softirq context:
  dm_softirq_done()
    dm_done()
      dm_end_request()
        rq_completed(run_queue=true)
          blk_run_queue()

Since queue_lock is always held with interrupt disabled,
I couldn't see why it could deadlock.

Request-based dm followed the completion model of scsi
mid layer. So similar code path exists in scsi, too.
For example:
  scsi_request_fn()
    scsi_kill_request()
      blk_complete_request()
then:
  scsi_softirq_done()
    scsi_io_completion()
      scsi_next_command()
        scsi_run_queue()
          spin_lock queue_lock
          __blk_run_queue()

If calling run-queue from softirq_done_fn() can cause deadlock,
I'm afraid the problem is not limited to dm.
