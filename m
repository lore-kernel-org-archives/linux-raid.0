No need to test it, just read copy_params() and its caller,
ctl_ioctl(). The latter passes a stack buffer as param_kernel, and
copy_params() does

        if (ioctl_flags & IOCTL_FLAGS_NO_PARAMS) {
                dmi = param_kernel;

with dmi later returned via *param. So it is entirely possible that
free_params ends up calling neither kfree or vfree, since there's
nothing to free.
