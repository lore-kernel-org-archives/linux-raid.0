It depends on the hardware design. My beaglebone black board's AES
engine can handle 1M at one time which is not big. As I know some
other AES engine can handle 16M data at one time or more.

Make sense.

Usually one bio does not always use the full 1M, maybe some 1k/2k/8k
or some other small chunks. But request can combine some sequential
small bios to be a big block and it is better than bio at least.
