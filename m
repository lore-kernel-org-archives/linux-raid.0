It's a normal multi-file problem. It can by-definition not be atomic
without doing really weird locking things.

Yeah, we've been there with the btrfs problem. For btrfs it woud
probably need to be something statfs()-like.

The links exist only for dm and md so far, I think. It's the classical
multiple-parents-in-a-tree problem. We have that for bonded network
devices and some IO buses too. There is no nice representation for
these reversed-trees-in-the-tree so far.
