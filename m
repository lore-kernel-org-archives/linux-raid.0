I know the anaconda team keeps pushing for the nonsense of being able to 
wipe drives on creation. It is wrong, it is broken, and it is not going 
to happen.

What defines readiness? Some believe a raid1 array must be fully 
assembled with all members, other setups are happy to have one running 
drive in place.....

4a/4b in your list here once again has no place in mdadm. Please kindly 
tell the anaconda team to go back and handle this properly instead.
